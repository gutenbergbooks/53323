  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE BY THE AMERICAN PUBLISHERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In presenting to the American public this new and beautiful edition of
a work that has been established as a favourite for nearly half a century,
the publishers do not think it needful to enlarge upon its merits, or to
point out the attractions which have secured for it a popularity so universal
and long continued. Fifteen editions in England, and probably an
equal or greater number in this country, have already borne testimony in
that behalf, much stronger than any praises which they can bestow. Yet
they may be permitted briefly to suggest a comparison between this charming
specimen of the good old school, and most of the illustrated works that
have recently been brought out in such profusion, professedly for the
entertainment and instruction of youth; works, in the majority of which
there is exhibited so little of that peculiar talent required for imparting
instruction with entertainment, and so little judgment in the choice of
subjects, as well as in the manner of dealing with them. The great defect
of these books—at least the greater portion of them—is the total want of
pure and unaffected simplicity; the principal characteristic of well-trained
youth, and therefore indispensable in everything designed for
youthful readers. Multitudes of authors have written, of late years, for
childhood; but small, indeed, is the number of those who, like Mrs. Barbauld
and Dr. Aikin, possess the faculty of adaptation to the tastes and
intellects of children; and in the effort to make books suited to those tastes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and intellects, they succeed only in producing things too puerile for
grown-up people, and so tainted with the affectation of simplicity that the
natural feelings of the child can give to them no sympathy. And it would
be a subject for rejoicing if this were the worst or only fault with which
some of them are chargeable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nearest approach to perfection that a book written for young people
can make, is to give the idea of having been written by one of them.
When a child reads a story, and fancies that he could write just such
another, we may be sure that the author has hit the mark. This test of
excellence the “Evenings at Home” bears with a success unrivalled, as
must be within the experience of many parents. There is scarcely another
book ever placed in the hands of children, from the age of four or five
years to that of twelve or fourteen, which they read with so much delight,
or remember so long and well, or by which they are so strongly incited to
the attempt at composition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Knowing the excellence of the work, and its enduring popularity, the
publishers have thought it worthy of a better style of publication than it
has ever enjoyed in this country; they have therefore brought out this
handsome edition on the best of paper, and for its embellishment secured
the valuable services of the same unrivalled engraver on wood who illustrated
their “Fairy Book,” and their editions of “Robinson Crusoe,” the
“Pilgrim’s Progress,” the “Life of Christ,” &amp;c.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH LONDON EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The thirteenth edition of “Evenings at Home,” a work which has not
been superseded in general estimation by any later publication for the
instruction and amusement of youth, appeared in 1823, enriched with the
addition of some new pieces, and carefully revised and corrected
throughout by Mr. Arthur Aikin. Since that time, its venerable author,
and his distinguished sister and coadjutor, have both paid the debt of
nature; and it appears proper to introduce this posthumous republication,
by an account of their respective shares in its production. The plan,
then, of the work originated solely with Dr. Aikin; the Introduction and
Epilogue are both his, and about eleven parts in twelve of the whole.
The pieces written by Mrs. Barbauld, including one found among her
papers, and now first printed, are, the Young Mouse; the Wasp and Bee;
Alfred, a Drama; Animals and their Countries; Canute’s Reproof to his
Courtiers; the Mask of Nature; Things by their Right Names; the
Goose and Horse; On Manufactures; the Flying-Fish; a Lesson on the
Art of Distinguishing; the Phenix and Dove; the Manufacture of
Paper; the Four Sisters; and Live Dolls;—amounting to fifteen out of
one hundred and one.</p>

<p class='c000'>A new arrangement of the matter has been followed in this edition, for
which the editor is answerable. Her father was precluded from attending
to this point in the first instance, by the manner in which the work grew
under his hand. The volumes came out one or two at a time, with an
interval of several years between the earliest and the latest. He did not
at first contemplate so extensive a work; but his invention flowed freely—the
applause of parents and the delight of children invited him to
proceed; the slight thread by which he had connected the pieces was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>capable of being drawn out indefinitely, and the plan was confessedly
that of a miscellany. Under these circumstances, it appeared allowable
on a view of the whole work, to change the order, so as to conduct the
young reader, in a gentle progress, from the easier pieces to the more
difficult; or rather, to adapt the different volumes to different ages, by
which the inconvenience might be avoided of either putting the whole
set into the hands of a child, while one portion of its contents would not
be intelligible to him, or withholding the whole until another portion
should have ceased to be interesting. This idea the editor has, to the
best of her ability, put in execution. Should she thus be the humble
means of extending, in any degree, the influence of her father’s wisdom
and genius—of his extensive knowledge, his manly principles, and his
genuine benevolence and tenderness of heart—her pains will be amply
rewarded.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The mansion-house of the pleasant village of <em>Beechgrove</em>, was
inhabited by the family of <span class='sc'>Fairborne</span>, consisting of the master and
mistress, and a numerous progeny of children of both sexes. Of these,
part were educated at home under their parents’ care, and part were sent
out to school. The house was seldom unprovided with visiters, the
intimate friends or relations of the owners, who were entertained with
cheerfulness and hospitality, free from ceremony and parade. They
formed, during their stay, part of the family; and were ready to
concur with Mr. and Mrs. Fairborne in any little domestic plan for
varying their amusements, and particularly for promoting the instruction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and entertainment of the younger part of the household. As some of
them were accustomed to writing, they would frequently produce a fable,
a story, or dialogue, adapted to the age and understanding of the young
people. It was always considered as a high favour when they would so
employ themselves; and when the pieces were once read over, they were
carefully deposited by Mrs. Fairborne in a box, of which she kept the
key. None of these were allowed to be taken out again till all the children
were assembled in the holydays. It was then made one of the evening
amusements of the family to <em>rummage the budget</em>, as their phrase was.
One of the least children was sent to the box, who putting in its little
hand, drew out the paper that came next, and brought it into the parlour.
This was then read distinctly by one of the older ones; and after it had
undergone sufficient consideration, another little messenger was despatched
for a fresh supply; and so on, till as much time had been spent in this
manner as the parents thought proper. Other children were admitted to
these readings; and as the <em>Budget of Beechgrove Hall</em> became somewhat
celebrated in the neighbourhood, its proprietors were at length urged to
lay it open to the public. They were induced to comply; and thus,
without further preface, begins the “First Evening.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE YOUNG MOUSE.—<span class='sc'>A Fable.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A young mouse lived in a cupboard where sweetmeats were kept; she
dined every day upon biscuit, marmalade, or fine sugar. Never had any
little mouse lived so well. She had often ventured to peep at the family
while they sat at supper; nay, she had sometimes stolen down on the
carpet, and picked up the crumbs, and nobody had ever hurt her. She
would have been quite happy, but that she was sometimes frightened by
the cat, and then she ran trembling to the hole behind the wainscot. One
day she came running to her mother in great joy. “Mother,” said she,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“the good people of this family have built me a house to live in; it is in
the cupboard: I am sure it is for me, for it is just big enough: the bottom
is of wood, and it is covered all over with wires! and I dare say they
have made it on purpose to screen me from that terrible cat, which ran
after me so often; there is an entrance just big enough for me, but puss
cannot follow; and they have been so good as to put in some toasted
cheese, which smells so deliciously, that I should have run in directly and
taken possession of my new house, but I thought I would tell you first,
that we might go in together, and both lodge there to-night, for it will
hold us both.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear child,” said the old mouse, “it is most happy that you did
not go in, for this house is called a trap, and you would never have come
out again, except to have been devoured, or put to death in some way or
other. Though man has not so fierce a look as a cat, he is as much our
enemy, and has still more cunning.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE WASP AND BEE.—<span class='sc'>A Fable.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A wasp met a bee, and said to him, “Pray, can you tell me what is the
reason that men are so ill-natured to me, while they are so fond of
you? We are both very much alike, only that the broad golden rings
about my body make me much handsomer than you are: we are both
winged insects, we both love honey, and we both sting people when we
are angry, yet men always hate me and try to kill me, though I am much
more familiar with them than you are, and pay them visits in their houses,
and at their tea-table, and at all their meals; while you are very shy, and
hardly ever come near them: yet they build you curious houses, thatched
with straw, and take care of and feed you in the winter very often:—I
wonder what is the reason?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The bee said, “Because you never do them any good, but, on the
contrary, are very troublesome and mischievous; therefore, they do not like
to see you, but they know that I am busy all day long in making them
honey. You had better pay them fewer visits, and try to be useful.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE GOOSE AND HORSE.—<span class='sc'>A Fable.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A goose, who was plucking grass upon a common, thought herself
affronted by a <em>horse</em> who fed near her, and in hissing accents thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>addressed him: “I am certainly a more noble and perfect animal than
you, for the whole range and extent of your faculties is confined to one
element. I can walk upon the ground as well as you: I have besides
wings, with which I can raise myself in the air; and when I please, I
can sport in ponds and lakes, and refresh myself in the cool waters: I
enjoy the different powers of a bird, a fish, and a quadruped.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>horse</em>, snorting somewhat disdainfully, replied, “It is true you
inhabit three elements, but you make no very distinguished figure in any
one of them. You fly, indeed; but your flight is so heavy and clumsy,
that you have no right to put yourself on a level with the lark or the
swallow. You can swim on the surface of the waters, but you cannot
live in them as fishes do; you cannot find your food in that element, nor
glide smoothly along the bottom of the waves. And when you walk, or
rather waddle, upon the ground, with your broad feet, and your long neck
stretched out, hissing at every one who passes by, you bring upon yourself
the derision of all beholders. I confess that I am only formed to move
upon the ground; but how graceful is my make! how well turned my
limbs! how highly finished my whole body! how great my strength!
how astonishing my speed! I had far rather be confined to one element,
and be admired in that, than be a <em>goose</em> in all.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE FLYING-FISH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The flying-fish, says the fable, had originally no wings, but being
of an ambitious and discontented temper, she repined at being always
confined to the waters, and wished to soar in the air. “If I could fly like
the birds,” said she, “I should not only see more of the beauties of nature,
but I should be able to escape from those fish which are continually
pursuing me, and which render my life miserable.” She therefore petitioned
Jupiter for a pair of wings; and immediately she perceived her fins to
expand. They suddenly grew to the length of her whole body, and
became at the same time so strong as to do the office of a pinion. She
was at first much pleased with her new powers, and looked with an air of
disdain on all her former companions; but she soon perceived herself
exposed to new dangers. When flying in the air, she was incessantly
pursued by the tropic bird and the albatross; and when for safety she
dropped into the water, she was so fatigued with her flight, that she was
less able than ever to escape from her old enemies the fish. Finding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>herself more unhappy than before, she now begged of Jupiter to recall his
present; but Jupiter said to her, “When I gave you your wings, I well knew
they would prove a curse; but your proud and restless disposition deserved
this disappointment. Now, therefore, what you begged as a favour, keep
as a punishment!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE LITTLE DOG.—<span class='sc'>A Fable.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“What shall I do,” said a very little dog one day to his mother, “to
show my gratitude to our good master, and make myself of some value
to him? I cannot draw or carry burdens, like the horse, nor give him
milk, like the cow; nor lend him my covering for his clothing, like the
sheep; nor produce him eggs, like the poultry; nor catch mice and rats
so well as the cat. I cannot divert him with singing, like the canaries
and linnets; nor can I defend him against robbers, like our relation
Towzer. I should not be of use to him even if I were dead, as the hogs
are. I am a poor insignificant creature, not worth the cost of keeping;
and I don’t see that I can do a single thing to entitle me to his regard.”
So saying, the poor little dog hung down his head in silent despondency.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear child,” replied his mother, “though your abilities are but
small, yet a hearty good will is sufficient to supply all defects. Do but
love him dearly, and prove your love by all the means in your power, and
you will not fail to please him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The little dog was comforted with this assurance; and on his master’s
approach, ran to him, licked his feet, gambolled before him, and every now
and then stopped, wagging his tail, and looking up to his master with
expressions of the most humble and affectionate attachment. The master
observed him. “Ah, little Fido,” said he, “you are an honest, good-natured
little fellow!”—and stooped down to pat his head. Poor Fido was
ready to go out of his wits for joy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fido was now his master’s constant companion in his walks, playing
and skipping round him, and amusing him by a thousand sportive tricks.
He took care, however, not to be troublesome by leaping on him with
dirty paws, nor would he follow him into the parlour, unless invited. He
also attempted to make himself useful by a number of little services.
He would drive away the sparrows as they were stealing the chickens’
food, and would run and bark with the utmost fury at any strange pigs
or other animals that offered to come into the yard. He kept the poultry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>geese, and pigs, from straying beyond their bounds, and particularly from
doing mischief in the garden. He was always ready to alarm Towzer
if there was any suspicious noise about the house, day or night. If his
master pulled off his coat in the field to help his workmen, as he would
sometimes do, Fido always sat by it, and would not suffer either man or
beast to touch it. By this means he came to be considered as a very
trusty protector of his master’s property.</p>

<p class='c000'>His master was once confined to his bed with a dangerous illness.
Fido planted himself at the chamber-door, and could not be persuaded to
leave it, even to take food; and as soon as his master was so far recovered
as to sit up, Fido being admitted into the room, ran up to him with
such marks of excessive joy and affection, as would have melted any
heart to behold. This circumstance wonderfully endeared him to his
master; and, some time after, he had an opportunity of doing him a very
important service. One hot day, after dinner, his master was sleeping in
a summer-house with Fido by his side. The building was old and crazy;
and the dog, who was faithfully watching his master, perceived the walls
shake, and pieces of mortar fall from the ceiling. He comprehended the
danger, and began barking to awake his master; and this not sufficing,
he jumped up and gently bit his finger. The master, upon this, started
up, and had just time to get out of the door before the whole building
fell down. Fido, who was behind, got hurt by some rubbish which
fell upon him; on which his master had him taken care of with the
utmost tenderness, and ever after acknowledged his obligation to this
animal as the preserver of his life. Thus his love and fidelity had their
full reward.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Moral.</span>—The poorest man may repay his obligations to the richest and
greatest by faithful and affectionate service—the meanest creature may
obtain the favour and regard of the Creator himself, by humble gratitude
and steadfast obedience.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>TRAVELLERS’ WONDERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>One winter’s evening, as <em>Captain Compass</em> was sitting by the fireside
with his children all around him, little Jack said to him, “Papa, pray tell
us some stories about what you have seen in your voyages. I have been
vastly entertained, while you were abroad, with Gulliver’s Travels, and
the Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor; and I think, as you have gone round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and round the world, you must have met with things as wonderful as they
did.”—“No, my dear,” said the captain, “I never met with Lilliputians
or Brobdignagians, I assure you, nor ever saw the black loadstone mountain,
or the valley of diamonds; but, to be sure, I have seen a great variety
of people, and their different manners and ways of living; and if it will
be any entertainment to you, I will tell you some curious particulars of
what I observed.”—“Pray do, papa,” cried Jack and all his brothers and
sisters: so they drew close round him, and he began as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, then—I was once, about this time of the year, in a country
where it was very cold, and the poor inhabitants had much ado to keep
themselves from starving. They were clad partly in the skins of beasts,
made smooth and soft by a particular art, but chiefly in garments made
from the outward covering of a middle-sized quadruped, which they were
so cruel as to strip off his back while he was alive. They dwelt in habitations,
part of which was sunk underground. The materials were either
stones, or earth hardened by fire; and so violent in that country were the
storms of wind and rain, that many of them covered their roofs all over
with stones. The walls of their houses had holes to let in the light: but
to prevent the cold air and wet from coming in, they were covered by a
sort of transparent stone, made artificially of melted sand or flints. As
wood was rather scarce, I know not what they would have done for firing,
had they not discovered in the bowels of the earth a very extraordinary
kind of stone, which when put among burning wood, caught fire and
flamed like a torch.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear me,” said Jack, “what a wonderful stone! I suppose it was
somewhat like what we call fire-stones, that shine so when we rub them
together.”—“I don’t think they would burn,” replied the captain; “besides,
these are of a darker colour.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well—but their diet too was remarkable. Some of them ate fish that
had been hung up in the smoke till they were quite dry and hard; and
along with it they ate either the roots of plants, or a sort of coarse black
cake made of powdered seeds. These were the poorer class; the richer
had a whiter kind of cake, which they were fond of daubing over with a
greasy matter that was the product of a large animal among them. This
grease they used, too, in almost all their dishes, and, when fresh, it really
was not unpalatable. They likewise devoured the flesh of many birds
and beasts when they could get it; and ate the leaves and other parts of
a variety of vegetables growing in the country, some absolutely raw,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>others variously prepared by the aid of fire. Another great article of
food was the curd of milk, pressed into a hard mass and salted. This had
so rank a smell, that persons of weak stomachs often could not bear to
come near it. For drink, they made great use of the water in which
certain dry leaves had been steeped. These leaves, I was told, came
from a great distance. They had likewise a method of preparing a liquor
of the seeds of a grasslike plant steeped in water with the addition of a
bitter herb, and then set to work or ferment. I was prevailed upon to
taste it, and thought it at first nauseous enough, but in time I liked it
pretty well. When a large quantity of the ingredients is used, it becomes
perfectly intoxicating. But what astonished me most, was their use of a
liquor so excessively hot and pungent that it seems like liquid fire. I once
got a mouthful of it by mistake, taking it for water, which it resembles in
appearance, but I thought it would instantly have taken away my breath.
Indeed, people are not unfrequently killed by it; and yet many of them
will swallow it greedily whenever they can get it. This, too, is said to
be prepared from the seeds abovementioned, which are innocent and even
salutary in their natural state, though made to yield such a pernicious
juice. The strangest custom that I believe prevails in any nation I found
here, which was, that some take a mighty pleasure in filling their mouths
full of stinking smoke and others, in thrusting a nasty powder up their
nostrils.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should think it would choke them,” said Jack. “It almost did me,”
answered his father, “only to stand by while they did it—but use, it is
truly said, is second nature.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was glad enough to leave this cold climate; and about half a year
after, I fell in with a people enjoying a delicious temperature of air, and
a country full of beauty and verdure. The trees and shrubs were furnished
with a great variety of fruits, which, with other vegetable products,
constituted a large part of the food of the inhabitants. I particularly
relished certain berries growing in bunches, some white and some red, of
a very pleasant sourish taste, and so transparent that one might see the
seeds at their very centre. Here were whole fields full of extremely
odoriferous flowers, which they told me were succeeded by pods bearing
seeds, that afforded good nourishment to man and beast. A great variety
of birds enlivened the groves and woods; among which I was entertained
with one, that without any teaching spoke almost as articulately as a
parrot, though indeed it was only a repetition of a single word. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>people were tolerably gentle and civilized, and possessed many of the
arts of life. Their dress was very various. Many were clad only in a
thin cloth made of the long fibres of the stalk of a plant cultivated for
the purpose, which they prepared by soaking in water, and then beating
with large mallets. Others wore cloth woven from a sort of vegetable
wool, growing in pods upon bushes. But the most singular material was
a fine glossy stuff, used chiefly by the richer classes, which, as I was
credibly informed, is manufactured out of the webs of caterpillars—a
most wonderful circumstance, if we consider the immense number of
caterpillars necessary to the production of so large a quantity of stuff as I
saw used. This people are very fantastic in their dress, especially the
women, whose apparel consists of a great number of articles impossible
to be described, and strangely disguising the natural form of the body.
In some instances they seem very cleanly; but in others, the Hottentots
can scarce go beyond them; particularly in the management of their hair,
which is all matted and stiffened with the fat of swine and other animals,
mixed up with powders of various colours and ingredients. Like most
Indian nations, they use feathers in their head-dress. One thing surprised
me much, which was, that they bring up in their houses an animal of the
tiger-kind, with formidable teeth and claws, which, notwithstanding its
natural ferocity, is played with and caressed by the most timid and
delicate of their women.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sure I would not play with it,” said Jack. “Why, you might
chance to get an ugly scratch if you did,” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The language of this nation seems very harsh and unintelligible to a
foreigner, yet they converse among one another with great ease and
quickness. One of the oddest customs is that which men use on saluting
each other. Let the weather be what it will, they uncover their heads,
and remain uncovered for some time, if they mean to be extraordinarily
respectful.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why that’s like pulling off our hats,” said Jack.—“Ah, ah! papa,”
cried Betsy, “I have found you out. You have been telling us of our
own country, and what is done at home, all this while!”—“But,” said
Jack, “we don’t burn stones or eat grease and powdered seeds, or wear
skins and caterpillars’ webs, or play with tigers.”—“No?” said the
Captain—“pray, what are coals but stones? and is not butter, grease;
and corn, seeds: and leather, skins; and silk, the web of a kind of
caterpillar? And may we not as well call a cat an animal of the tiger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>kind, as a tiger an animal of the cat-kind? So, if you recollect what I
have been describing, you will find, with Betsy’s help, that all the other
wonderful things I have told you of are matters familiar among ourselves.
But I meant to show you, that a foreigner might easily represent everything
as equally strange and wonderful among us as we could do with
respect to his country; and also to make you sensible that we daily call
a great many things by their names, without ever inquiring into their
nature and properties; so that, in reality, it is only their names, and not
the things themselves, with which we are acquainted.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE DISCONTENTED SQUIRREL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In a pleasant wood, on the western side of a ridge of mountains, there
lived a <em>squirrel</em>, who had passed two or three years of his life very
happily. At length, he began to grow discontented, and one day fell
into the following soliloquy:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“What, must I spend all my time in this spot, running up and down
the same trees, gathering nuts and acorns, and dozing away months
together in a hole! I see a great many of the birds who inhabit this
wood ramble about to a distance wherever their fancy leads them; and,
at the approach of winter, set out for some remote country, where they
enjoy summer weather all the year round. My neighbour cuckoo tells
me he is just going; and even little nightingale will soon follow. To
be sure, I have not wings like them, but I have legs nimble enough; and
if one does not use them, one might as well be a mole or a dormouse. I
dare say I could easily reach to that blue ridge which I see from the tops
of the trees, which no doubt must be a fine place; for the sun comes
directly from it every morning, and it often appears all covered with red
and yellow, and the finest colours imaginable. There can be no harm, at
least, in trying; for I can soon get back again if I don’t like it. I am
resolved to go, and I will set out to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When squirrel had taken this resolution, he could not sleep all night
for thinking of it; and at peep of day, prudently taking with him as much
provision as he could conveniently carry, he began his journey in high
spirits. He presently got to the outside of the wood, and entered upon
the open moors that reached to the foot of the hills. These he crossed
before the sun was gotten high; and then, having eaten his breakfast
with an excellent appetite, he began to ascend. It was heavy toilsome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>work scrambling up the steep sides of the mountains; but squirrel was
used to climbing; so for awhile he proceeded expeditiously. Often,
however, was he obliged to stop and take breath; so that it was a good
deal past noon before he had arrived at the summit of the first cliff.
Here he sat down to eat his dinner; and looking back, was wonderfully
pleased with the fine prospect. The wood in which he lived lay far
beneath his feet; and he viewed with scorn the humble habitation in
which he had been born and bred.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he looked forward, however, he was somewhat discouraged to
observe that another eminence rose above him, full as distant as that to
which he had already reached; and he now began to feel stiff and fatigued.
However, after a little rest, he set out again, though not so briskly as
before. The ground was rugged, brown, and bare; and to his great
surprise, instead of finding it warmer as he got nearer the sun, he felt it
grow colder and colder. He had not travelled two hours before his
strength and spirits were almost spent; and he seriously thought of giving
up the point, and returning before night should come on. While he was
thus deliberating with himself, clouds began to gather round the mountain,
and to take away all view of distant objects. Presently, a storm of
mingled snow and hail came down, driven by a violent wind, which
pelted poor squirrel most pitifully, and made him quite unable to move
forward or backward. Besides, he had completely lost his road, and
did not know which way to turn toward that despised home which it was
now his only desire again to reach. The storm lasted till the approach
of night; and it was as much as he could do, benumbed and weary as he
was, to crawl to the hollow of a rock at some distance, which was the
best lodging he could find for the night. His provisions were spent; so
that, hungry and shivering, he crept into the farthest corner of the cavern,
and rolling himself up, with his bushy tail over his back, he got a little
sleep, though disturbed by the cold, and the shrill whistling of the wind
among the stones.</p>

<p class='c000'>The morning broke over the distant tops of the mountains, when
squirrel, half frozen and famished, came out of his lodging, and advanced,
as well as he could, toward the brow of the hill, that he might discover
which way to take. As he was slowly creeping along, a hungry kite,
soaring in the air above, descried him, and making a stoop carried him off
in her talons. Poor squirrel, losing his senses with the fright, was borne
away with vast rapidity, and seemed inevitably doomed to become food
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>for the kite’s young ones: when an eagle, who had seen the kite seize her
prey, pursued her in order to take it from her; and overtaking her, gave
her such a buffet, as caused her to drop the squirrel in order to defend
herself. The poor animal kept falling through the air a long time, till at
last he alighted in the midst of a thick tree, the leaves and tender boughs
of which so broke his fall, that, though stunned and breathless, he
escaped without material injury, and after lying a while, came to himself
again. But what was his pleasure and surprise, to find himself in the
very tree which contained his nest. “Ah!” said he, “my dear native
place and peaceful home! if ever I am again tempted to leave you, may I
undergo a second time all the miseries and dangers from which I have
now so wonderfully escaped.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ON THE MARTEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Look up, my dear,” said his papa to Little William, “at those birds’nests
above the chamber-windows, beneath the eaves of the house. Some,
you see, are just begun—nothing but a little clay stuck against the wall.
Others are half finished; and others are quite built—close and tight—leaving
nothing but a small hole for the birds to come in and go out at.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are they?” said William.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are martens’ nests,” replied his father; “and there you see the
owners. How busily they fly backward and forward, bringing clay and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>dirt in their bills, and laying it upon their work, forming it into shape
with their bills and feet! The nests are built very strong and thick, like
a mud wall, and are lined with feathers to make a soft bed for the young.
Martens are a kind of swallows. They feed on flies, gnats, and other
insects; and always build in towns and villages about the houses.
People do not molest them, for they do good rather than harm, and it is
very amusing to view their manners and actions. See how swiftly they
skim through the air in pursuit of their prey! In the morning they are
up by daybreak, and twitter about your window while you are asleep in
bed; and all day long they are upon the wing, getting food for themselves
and their young. As soon as they have caught a few flies, they hasten
to their nests, pop into the hole, and feed their little ones. I’ll tell you a
story about the great care they take of their young. A pair of martens
once built their nest in a porch; and when they had young ones, it
happened that one of them climbing up to the hole before he was fledged,
fell out, and, lighting upon the stones, was killed. The old birds,
perceiving this accident, went and got short bits of strong straw, and
stuck them with mud, like palisades, all round the hole of the nest, in
order to keep the other little ones from tumbling after their poor brother.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How cunning that was!” cried William.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said his father; “and I can tell you another story of their
sagacity, and also of their disposition to help one another. A saucy
cock-sparrow (you know what impudent rogues they are!) had got into
a marten’s nest while the owner was abroad; and when he returned, the
sparrow put his head out of the hole and pecked at the marten with open
bill, as he attempted to enter his own house. The poor marten was sadly
provoked at this injustice, but was unable by his own strength to right
himself. So he flew away and gathered a number of his companions,
who all came with bits of clay in their bills, with which they plastered
up the hole of the nest, and kept the sparrow in prison, who died miserably
for want of food and air.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was rightly served,” said William.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So he was,” rejoined his papa. “Well; I have more to say about the
sagacity of these birds. In autumn, when it begins to be cold weather,
the other swallows assemble upon the roofs of high buildings, and prepare
for their departure to a warmer country; for as all the insects here die in
the winter, they would have nothing to live on if they were to stay.
They take several short flights in flocks round and round, in order to try
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>their strength, and then on some fine calm day, they set out together for a
long journey southward, over sea and land, to a very distant country.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how do they find their way?” said William.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We say,” answered his father, “that they are taught by <em>instinct</em>; that
is, God has implanted in their minds a desire of travelling at the season
which he knows to be proper, and has also given them an impulse to take
the right road. They steer their course through the wide air directly to
the proper spot. Sometimes, however, storms and contrary winds meet
them and drive the poor birds about till they are quite spent and fall into
the sea, unless they happen to meet with a ship, on which they can light
and rest themselves. The swallows from this country are supposed to go
as far as the middle of Africa to spend the winter, where the weather is
always warm, and insects are to be met with all the year. In spring they
take another long journey back again to these northern countries. Sometimes,
when we have fine weather very early, a few of them come too
soon; for when it changes to frost and snow again, the poor creatures
are starved for want of food, or perish from the cold. Hence arises the
proverb,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘One swallow does not make a summer.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But when a great many of them are come, we may be sure that winter is
over, so that we are always very glad to see them again. The martens
find their way back over a great length of sea and land to the very same
villages and houses where they were bred. This has been discovered by
catching some of them, and marking them. They repair their old nests,
or build new ones, and then set about laying eggs and hatching their
young. Pretty things! I hope you will never knock down their nests, or
take their eggs or young ones! for, as they come such a long way to visit
us, and lodge in our houses without fear, we ought to use them kindly.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>MOUSE, LAPDOG, AND MONKEY.—<span class='sc'>A Fable.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A poor little mouse, being half starved, ventured one day to steal from
behind the wainscot while the family were at dinner, and, trembling all
the while, picked up a few crumbs which were scattered on the ground.
She was soon observed, however; everybody was immediately alarmed;
some called for the cat; others took up whatever was at hand, and
endeavoured to crush her to pieces; and the poor terrified animal was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>driven round the room in an agony of terror. At length, however, she
was fortunate enough to gain her hole, where she sat panting with fatigue.
When the family were again seated, a lapdog and a monkey came into
the room. The former jumped into the lap of his mistress, fawned upon
every one of the children, and made his court so effectually, that he was
rewarded with some of the best morsels of the entertainment. The
monkey, on the other hand, forced himself into notice by his grimaces.
He played a thousand little mischievous tricks, and was regaled, at the
appearance of the dessert, with plenty of nuts and apples. The unfortunate
little mouse, who saw from her hiding-place everything that passed,
sighed in anguish of heart, and said to herself, “Alas! how ignorant was
I, to imagine that poverty and distress were sufficient recommendations
to the charity of the opulent. I now find, that whoever is not master of
fawning and buffoonery, is but ill qualified for a dependant, and will not
be suffered even to pick up the crumbs that fall from the table.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Who is this beautiful Virgin that approaches clothed in a robe of light
green? She has a garland of flowers on her head, and flowers spring up
wherever she sets her foot. The snow, which covered the fields, and the
ice, which was in the rivers, melt away when she breathes upon them. The
young lambs frisk about her, and the birds warble in their little throats to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>welcome her coming; and when they see her, they begin to choose their
mates, and to build their nests. Youths and maidens have you seen this
beautiful Virgin? If you have, tell me who she is, and what is her name.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who is this that cometh from the south, thinly clad in a light transparent
garment; her breath is hot and sultry; she seeks the refreshment of
the cool shade; she seeks the clear streams, and crystal brooks, to bathe
her languid limbs? The brooks and rivulets fly from her, and are dried
up at her approach. She cools her parched lips with berries, and the
grateful acid of all fruits,—the seedy melon, the sharp apple, and the red
pulp of the juicy cherry, which are poured out plentifully around her.
The tanned haymakers welcome her coming; and the sheepshearer,
who clips the fleeces off his flock with his sounding shears. When she
cometh let me lie under the thick shade of a spreading beach-tree—let
me walk with her in the early morning, when the dew is yet upon the
grass—let me wander with her in the soft twilight, when the shepherd
shuts his fold, and the star of evening appears. Who is she that cometh
from the south? Youths and maidens, tell me, if you know, who she is,
and what is her name.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who is he that cometh with sober pace, stealing upon us unawares?
His garments are red with the blood of the grape, and his temples are
bound with a sheaf of ripe wheat. His hair is thin and begins to fall,
and the auburn is mixed with mournful gray. He shakes the brown nuts
from the tree. He winds the horn, and calls the hunters to their sport.
The gun sounds:—the trembling partridge and the beautiful pheasant
flutter, bleeding in the air, and fall dead at the sportsman’s feet. Who is
he that is crowned with a wheat-sheaf? Youths and maidens, tell me, if
you know, who he is, and what is his name.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who is he that cometh from the north, clothed in furs and warm
wool? He wraps his cloak close about him. His head is bald; his
beard is made of sharp icicles. He loves the blazing fire high piled upon
the hearth, and the wine sparkling in the glass. He binds skates to his
feet, and skims over the frozen lakes. His breath is piercing and cold,
and no little flower dares to peep above the surface of the ground, when
he is by. Whatever he touches turns to ice. If he were to stroke you
with his cold hand, you would be quite stiff and dead, like a piece of
marble. Youths and maidens, do you see him? He is coming fast upon
us, and soon he will be here. Tell me, if you know, who he is, and

<h3 class='c012'>JOURNAL.</h3>

<p class='c013'><em>June 10th.</em> Last night we had a dreadful alarm. A violent scream
was heard from the henroost; the geese all set up a cackle, and the dogs
barked. Ned, the boy who lies over the stable, jumped up, and ran into
the yard, when he observed a fox galloping away with a chicken in his
mouth, and the dogs in full chase after him. They could not overtake
him, and soon returned. Upon further examination, the large white cock
was found lying on the ground, all bloody, with his comb torn almost off,
and his feathers all ruffled, and the speckled hen and three chickens lay
dead beside him. The cock recovered, but appeared terribly frightened.
It seems that the fox had jumped over the garden-hedge, and then
crossing part of the yard behind the straw, had crept into the henroost
through a broken pale. John the carpenter was sent for, to make all fast,
and prevent the like mischief again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early this morning the brindled cow was delivered of a fine bull-calf.
Both are likely to do well. The calf is to be fattened for the butcher.</p>

<p class='c000'>The duck-eggs that were sat upon by the old black hen, were hatched
this day, and the ducklings all directly ran into the pond, to the great
terror of the hen, who went round and round, clucking with all her
might in order to call them out, but they did not regard her. An old
drake took the little ones under his care, and they swam about very
merrily.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>As Dolly this morning was milking the new cow that was bought at
the fair, she kicked with her hind legs, and threw down the milk-pail, at
the same time knocking Dolly off her stool into the dirt. For this offence
the cow was sentenced to have her head fastened to the rack, and her
legs tied together.</p>

<p class='c000'>A kite was observed to hover a long while over the yard with an
intention of carrying off some of the young chickens, but the hens called
their broods together under their wings, and the cocks put themselves in
order of battle, so that the kite was disappointed. At length, one chicken,
not minding its mother, but straggling heedlessly to a distance, was
descried by the kite, who made a sudden swoop, and seized it in his
talons. The chicken cried out, and the cocks and hens all screamed;
when Ralph, the farmer’s son, who saw the attack, snatched up a loaded
gun, and just as the kite was flying off with his prey, fired and brought
him dead to the ground, along with the poor chicken, who was killed in
the fall. The dead body of the kite was nailed up against the wall, by
way of a warning to his wicked comrades.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the forenoon we were alarmed with strange noises approaching us,
and looking out we saw a number of people with frying-pans, warming-pans,
tongs, and pokers, beating, ringing, and making all possible din.
We soon discovered them to be our neighbours of the next farm, in
pursuit of a swarm of bees which was hovering in the air over their
heads. The bees at length alighted on the tall pear-tree in our orchard,
and hung in a bunch from one of the boughs. A ladder was got, and a
man ascending, with gloves on his hands, and an apron tied over his
head, swept them into a hive which was rubbed on the inside with honey
and sweet herbs. But as he was descending, some bees, which had got
under his gloves, stung him in such a manner, that he hastily threw down
the hive, upon which the greater part of the bees fell out, and began in a
rage to fly among the crowd, and sting all whom they lit upon. Away
scampered the people, the women shrieking, the children roaring; and
poor Adam, who had held the hive, was assailed so furiously, that he
was obliged to throw himself on the ground, and creep under the gooseberry-bushes.
At length, the bees began to return to the hive, in which
the queen-bee had remained; and after a while, all being quietly settled,
a cloth was thrown over it, and the swarm was carried home.</p>

<p class='c000'>About noon, three pigs broke into the garden, where they were rioting
upon the carrots and turnips, and doing a great deal of mischief by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>trampling the beds and rooting up the plants with their snouts, when
they were spied by old Towzer the mastiff, who ran among them, and
laying hold of their long ears with his teeth, made them squeal most
dismally, and get out of the garden as fast as they could.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roger the ploughman, when he came for his dinner, brought
word that he had discovered a partridge’s nest with sixteen eggs in the
home-field. Upon which the farmer went out and broke them all;
saying, that he did not choose to rear birds upon his corn, which he was
not allowed to catch, but must leave to some qualified sportsman, who
would besides break down his fences in the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'>A sheep-washing was held this day at the mill-pool, when seven-score
were well washed, and then penned in the high meadow to dry. Many
of them made great resistance at being thrown into the water; and the
old ram being dragged to the brink by a boy at each horn, and a third
pushing behind, by a sudden spring threw two of them into the water, to
the great diversion of the spectators.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward the dusk of the evening, the squire’s mongrel greyhound, which
had been long suspected of worrying sheep, was caught in the fact. He
had killed two lambs, and was making a hearty meal upon one of them,
when he was disturbed by the approach of the shepherd’s boy, and directly
leaped the hedge and made off. The dead bodies were taken to the
squire’s, with an endictment of wilful murder against the dog. But
when they came to look for the culprit, he was not to be found in any
part of the premises, and is supposed to have fled his country through
consciousness of his heinous offence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph, who sleeps in the garret at the old end of the house, after
having been some time in bed, came down stairs in his shirt, as pale as
ashes, and frightened the maids, who were going up. It was some time
before he could tell what was the matter; at length, he said he had heard
some dreadful noises overhead, which he was sure must be made by some
ghost or evil spirit; nay, he thought he had seen something moving,
though he owned he durst hardly lift up his eyes. He concluded with
declaring, that he would rather sit up all night in the kitchen than go to
his room again. The maids were almost as much alarmed as he, and did
not know what to do; but their master overhearing their talk, came out
and insisted upon their accompanying him to the spot, in order to search
into the affair. They all went into the garret, and for a while heard
nothing; when their master ordered the candle to be taken away, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>every one to keep quite still. Joseph and the maids stuck close to each
other, and trembled every limb. At length, a kind of groaning or
snoring began to be heard, which grew louder and louder, with intervals
of a strange sort of hissing. “That’s it!” whispered Joseph, drawing
back toward the door—the maids were ready to sink, and even the
farmer himself was a little disconcerted. The noise seemed to come
from the rafters near the thatch. In a while a glimpse of moonlight
shining through a hole at the place, plainly discovered the shadow of
something stirring; and on looking intently, something like feathers
was perceived. The farmer now began to suspect what the case was;
and ordering up a short ladder bid Joseph climb to the spot, and thrust
his hand into the hole. This he did rather unwillingly, and soon drew
it back, crying loudly that he was bit. However, gathering courage, he
put it in again, and pulled out a large white owl, another at the same
time being heard to fly away. The cause of the alarm was now made
clear enough; and poor Joseph, after being heartily jeered by the maids,
though they had been as much frightened as he, sneaked into bed, and
the house soon became quiet.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE PRICE OF PLEASURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“I think I will take a ride,” said the little <em>Lord Linger</em>, after breakfast;
“bring me my boots, and let my horse be brought to the door.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The horse was saddled, and his lordship’s spurs were putting on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said he, “I’ll have my low chair and the ponies, and take a drive
round the park.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The horse was led back, and the ponies were almost harnessed, when
his lordship sent his valet to countermand them. He would walk into
the cornfield, and see how the new pointer hunted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After all,” says he, “I think I will stay at home, and play a game or
two at billiards.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He played half a game, but could not make a stroke to please himself.
His tutor, who was present, now thought it a good opportunity to ask his
lordship if he would read a little.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why—I think—I will; for I am tired of doing nothing. What shall
we have?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your lordship left off last time in one of the finest passages of the
Æneid. Suppose we finish it?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Well—ay; but—no—I had rather go on with Hume’s history. Or—suppose
we do some geography?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With all my heart. The globes are upon the study-table.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They went to the study; and the little lord, leaning upon his elbows,
looked at the globe—then twirled it round two or three times—and then
listened patiently while the tutor explained some of its parts and uses.
But while he was in the midst of a problem, “Come,” said his lordship,
“now for a little Virgil.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The book was brought; and the pupil, with a good deal of help, got
through twenty lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said he, ringing the bell, “I think we have done a good deal.
Tom! bring my bow and arrows.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fine London-made bow, in its green case, and the quiver with all
its appurtenances, were brought, and his lordship went down to the place
where the shooting-butts were erected. He aimed a few shots at the
target, but not coming near it, he shot all the remainder at random, and
then ordered out his horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sauntered, with a servant at his heels, for a mile or two through
the lanes, and came, just as the clock struck twelve, to a village-green,
close by which a school was kept. A door flew open, and out burst a
shoal of boys, who, spreading over the green, with immoderate vociferation,
instantly began a variety of sports. Some fell to marbles, some to
trap-ball, some to leap-frog. In short, not one of the whole crew but was
eagerly employed. Everything was noise, motion, and pleasure. Lord
Linger, riding slowly up, espied one of his tenants’ sons, who had been
formerly admitted as a playfellow of his, and called him from the throng.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jack,” said he, “how do you like school?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“O, pretty well, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What—have you a good deal of play?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“O no! We have only from twelve to two for playing and eating our
dinners; and then an hour before supper.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is very little, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But <em>we play heartily when we do play, and work when we work</em>.
Good-by, my lord! it is my turn to go in at trap!”</p>

<p class='c000'>So saying, Jack ran off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish I was a school-boy!” cried the little lord to himself.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE RAT WITH A BELL.—<span class='sc'>A Fable.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A large old house in the country was so extremely infested with rats
that nothing could be secured from their depredations. They scaled the
walls to attack flitches of bacon, though hung as high as the ceiling.
Hanging shelves afforded no protection to the cheese and pastry. They
penetrated by sap into the store-room, and plundered it of preserves and
sweetmeats. They gnawed through cupboard-doors, undermined floors,
and ran races behind the wainscots. The cats could not get at them;
they were too cunning and too well fed to meddle with poison; and traps
only now and then caught a heedless straggler. One of these, however,
on being taken, was the occasion of practising a new device. This was,
to fasten a collar with a small bell about the prisoner’s neck, and then
turn him loose again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Overjoyed at the recovery of his liberty, the rat ran into the nearest
hole, and went in search of his companions. They heard at a distance
the bell tinkle-tinkle through the dark passages, and suspecting some
enemy had got among them, away they scoured, some one way and some
another. The bell-bearer pursued; and soon guessing the cause of their
flight, he was greatly amused by it. Wherever he approached, it was all
hurry-scurry, and not a tail of one of them was to be seen. He chased
his old friends from hole to hole, and room to room, laughing all the
while at their fears, and increasing them by all the means in his power.
Presently, he had the whole house to himself. “That’s right,” quoth he,
“the fewer the better cheer.” So he rioted alone among the good things,
and stuffed till he could hardly walk.</p>

<p class='c000'>For two or three days this course of life went on very pleasantly. He
ate, and ate, and played the bugbear to perfection. At length, he grew tired
of this lonely condition, and longed to mix with his companions again
upon the former footing. But the difficulty was, how to get rid of his
bell. He pulled and tugged with his fore-feet, and almost wore the skin
off his neck in the attempt, but all in vain. The bell was now his plague
and torment. He wandered from room to room earnestly desiring to
make himself known to one of his companions, but they all kept out of
his reach. At last, as he was moping about disconsolate he fell in puss’s
way, and was devoured in an instant.</p>

<p class='c000'>He who is raised so much above his fellow-creatures as to be the object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of their terror, must suffer for it in losing all the comforts of society. He
is a solitary being in the midst of crowds. He keeps them at a distance,
and they equally shun him. Dread and affection cannot subsist together.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE KID.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>One bleak day in March, <em>Sylvia</em>, returning from a visit to the sheepfold,
met with a young kidling deserted by its dam on the naked heath. It was
bleating piteously, and was so benumbed with the cold that it could
scarcely stand. Sylvia took it up in her arms, and pressed it close to her
bosom. She hastened home, and showing her little foundling to her
parents, begged she might rear it for her own. They consented; and
Sylvia immediately got a basketful of clean straw, and made a bed for
him on the hearth. She warmed some milk, and held it to him in a platter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The poor creature drank it up eagerly, and then licked her hand for
more. <em>Sylvia</em> was delighted. She chafed his tender legs with her
warm hands, and soon saw him jump out of his basket and frisk across
the room. When full, he lay down again, and took a comfortable nap.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day, the kid had a name bestowed upon him. As he gave
tokens of being an excellent jumper, it was <em>Capriole</em>. He was introduced
to all the rest of the family, and the younger children were allowed to
stroke and pat him; but Sylvia would let nobody be intimate with him
out herself. The great mastiff was charged not to hurt him, and indeed,
he had no intention to do it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within a few days, Capriole followed Sylvia all about the house;
trotted by her side into the yard; ran races with her in the home-field;
fed out of her hand; and was declared pet and favourite. As the spring
advanced, Sylvia roamed in the fields, and gathered wild flowers, with
which she wove garlands, and hung them round the kid’s neck. He
could not be kept, however, from munching his finery when he could
reach it with his mouth. He was likewise rather troublesome in
thrusting his nose into the meal-tub and flour-box, and following people
into the dairy, and sipping the milk that was set for cream. He now and
then got a blow for his intrusion; but his mistress always took his part,
and indulged him in every liberty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capriole’s horns now began to bud, and a little white beard sprouted
at the end of his chin. He grew bold enough to put himself into a
fighting posture whenever he was offended. He butted down little Colin
into the dirt; quarrelled with the geese for their allowance of corn; and
held many a stout battle with the old turkey-cock. Everybody said,
“Capriole is growing too saucy; he must be sent away, or taught better
manners.” But Sylvia still stood his friend, and he repaid her love with
many tender caresses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The farmhouse where Sylvia lived was situated in a sweet valley, by
the side of a clear stream bordered with trees. Above the house rose a
sloping meadow, and beyond that, was an open common covered with
purple heath and yellow furze. Farther on, at some distance, rose a steep
hill, the summit of which was a bare craggy rock, scarcely accessible to
human feet. Capriole, ranging at his pleasure, often got upon the
common, and was pleased with browsing the short grass and wild herbs
which grew there. Still, however, when his mistress came to see him,
he would run bounding at her call and accompany her back to the farm.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>One fine summer’s day, Sylvia, after having finished the business of
the morning, wanted to play with her kid; and missing him, she went
to the side of the common, and called aloud, “Capriole! Capriole!”
expecting to see him come running to her as usual. No Capriole came.
She went on and on, still calling her kid with the most endearing
accents; but nothing was to be seen of him. Her heart began to flutter.
“What can be come of him? Surely somebody must have stolen him; or
perhaps the neighbours’ dogs have worried him. Oh, my poor Capriole! my
dear Capriole! I shall never see you again!” and Sylvia began to weep.</p>

<p class='c000'>She still went on, looking wistfully all around, and making the place
echo with “Capriole! Capriole! where are you, my Capriole?” till, at
length, she came to the foot of the steep hill. She climbed up its sides
to get a better view. No kid was to be seen. She sat down and wept
and wrung her hands. After a while she fancied she heard a bleating
like the well-known voice of her Capriole. She started up, and looked
toward the sound, which seemed a great way overhead. At length, she
spied, just on the edge of a steep crag, her Capriole peeping over. She
stretched out her hands to him, and began to call, but with a timid voice,
lest in his impatience to return to her, he should leap down and break
his neck. But there was no such danger. Capriole was inhaling the
fresh breeze of the mountains, and enjoying with rapture the scenes for
which nature designed him. His bleating was the expression of joy,
and he bestowed not a thought on his kind mistress, nor paid the least
attention to her call. Sylvia ascended as high as she could toward him,
and called louder and louder, but all in vain. Capriole leaped from rock
to rock, cropped the fine herbage in the clefts, and was quite lost in the
pleasure of his new existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Sylvia stayed till she was tired, and then returned disconsolate
to the farm, to relate her misfortune. She got her brothers to accompany
her back to the hill, and took with her a slice of white bread and some
milk to tempt the little wanderer home. But he had mounted still higher,
and had joined a herd of companions of the same species, with whom he
was frisking and sporting. He had neither eyes nor ears for his old
friends of the valley. All former habits were broken at once, and he had
commenced free commoner of nature. Sylvia came back crying, as
much from vexation as sorrow. “The little ungrateful thing,” said she;
“so well as I loved him, and so kindly as I treated him, to desert me in
this way at last!—But he was always a rover.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Take care, then, Sylvia,” said her mother, “how you set your heart
upon <em>rovers</em> again!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Robinet, a peasant of Lorraine, after a hard day’s work at the next
market-town, was running home with a basket in his hand. “What a
delicious supper shall I have!” said he to himself. “This piece of kid
well stewed down, with my onions sliced, thickened with my meal, and
seasoned with my salt and pepper, will make a dish for the bishop of the
diocese. Then I have a good piece of barley-loaf at home to finish with.
How I long to be at it!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A noise in the hedge now attracted his notice, and he spied a squirrel
nimbly running up a tree, and popping into a hole between the branches.
“Ha!” thought he, “what a nice present a nest of young squirrels will
be to my little master! I’ll try if I can get it.” Upon this, he set down
his basket in the road, and began to climb the tree. He had half
ascended, when casting a look at his basket, he saw a dog with his nose
in it, ferreting out the piece of kid’s flesh. He made all possible speed
down, but the dog was too quick for him, and ran off with the meat in
his mouth. Robinet looked after him. “Well,” said he, “then I must
be contented with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupe maigre</span>—and no bad thing neither.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He travelled on, and came to a little public-house by the roadside,
where an acquaintance of his was sitting on a bench drinking. He
invited Robinet to take a draught. Robinet seated himself by his friend,
and set his basket on the bench close by him. A tame raven, which was
kept at the house, came slyly behind him, and perching on the basket,
stole away the bag in which the meal was tied up, and hopped off with
it to his hole. Robinet did not perceive the theft till he had got on his
way again. He returned to search for his bag, but could hear no tidings
of it. “Well,” says he, “my soup will be the thinner; but I will boil a
slice of bread with it, and that will do it some good at least.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He went on again, and arrived at a little brook, over which was laid a
narrow plank. A young woman coming up to pass at the same time,
Robinet gallantly offered his hand. As soon as she was got to the
middle, either through fear or sport, she shrieked out, and cried she was
falling. Robinet hastening to support her with his other hand, let his
basket drop into the stream. As soon as she was safe over, he jumped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>in and recovered it; but when he took it out he perceived that all the salt
was melted, and the pepper washed away. Nothing was now left but
the onions. “Well!” says Robinet, “then I must sup to-night upon
roasted onions and barley-bread. Last night I had the bread alone.
To-morrow morning it will not signify what I had.” So saying, he
trudged on singing as before.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>ORDER AND DISORDER.—<span class='sc'>A Fairy Tale.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Juliet was a clever, well-disposed girl, but apt to be heedless. She
could learn her lessons very well, but commonly as much time was
taken up in getting her things together as in doing what she was set
about. If she was at work, there was generally the housewife to seek
in one place, and the thread-papers in another. The scissors were left in
her pocket upstairs, and the thimble was rolling about the floor. In
writing, the copybook was generally missing, the ink dried up, and the
pens, new and old, all tumbled about the cupboard. The slate and slate-pencil
were never found together. In making her exercises, the English
dictionary always came to hand instead of the French grammar; and
when she was to read a chapter, she usually got hold of Robinson
Crusoe, or the World Displayed, instead of the Testament.</p>

<p class='c000'>Juliet’s mamma was almost tired of teaching her, so she sent her to
make a visit to an old lady in the country, a very good woman, but rather
strict with young folks. Here she was shut up in a room above stairs by
herself after breakfast every day, till she had quite finished the tasks set
her. This house was one of the very few that are still haunted by fairies.
One of these, whose name was <em>Disorder</em>, took a pleasure in plaguing
poor Juliet. She was a frightful figure to look at, being crooked and
squint-eyed, with her hair hanging about her face, and her dress put on
all awry, and full of rents and tatters. She prevailed on the old lady to
let her set Juliet her tasks; so one morning she came up with a workbag
full of threads of silk of all sorts of colours, mixed and entangled together,
and a flower very nicely worked to copy. It was a pansy, and the
gradual melting of its hues into one another was imitated with great
accuracy and beauty. “Here, miss,” said she, “my mistress has sent
you a piece of work to do, and she insists upon having it done before you
come down to dinner. You will find all the materials in this bag.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Juliet took the flower and the bag, and turned out all the silks upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the table. She slowly pulled out a red and a purple, and a blue and a
yellow, and at length fixed upon one to begin working with. After
taking two or three stitches, and looking at her model, she found another
shade was wanted. This was to be hunted out from the bunch, and a
long while it took her to find it. It was soon necessary to change it for
another. Juliet saw that, in going on at this rate, it would take days
instead of hours to work the flower, so she laid down the needle and fell
a crying. After this had continued some time, she was startled at the
sound of something stamping on the floor; and taking her handkerchief
from her eyes, she spied a diminutive female figure advancing toward
her. She was upright as an arrow, and had not so much as a hair out of
its place, or the least article of her dress rumpled or discomposed. When
she came up to Juliet, “My dear,” said she, “I heard you crying, and
knowing you to be a good girl in the main, I am come to your assistance.
My name is <em>Order</em>: your mamma is well acquainted with me, though
this is the first time you ever saw me; but I hope we shall know one
another better for the future.” She then jumped upon the table, and with
a wand gave a tap upon the heap of entangled silk.—Immediately the
threads separated, and arranged themselves in a long row consisting
of little skeins, in which all of the same colour were collected together,
those approaching nearest in shade being placed next each other. This
done, she disappeared. Juliet, as soon as her surprise was over, resumed
her work, and found it go on with ease and pleasure. She finished the
flower by dinner-time, and obtained great praise for the neatness of the
execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day the ill-natured fairy came up, with a great book under
her arm. “This,” said she, “is my mistress’s house-book, and she says
you must draw out against dinner an exact account of what it has cost
her last year in all the articles of housekeeping, including clothes, rent,
taxes, wages, and the like. You must state separately the amount of
every article, under the heads of baker, butcher, milliner, shoemaker, and
so forth, taking special care not to miss a single thing entered down in
the book. Here is a quire of paper and a parcel of pens.” So saying,
with a malicious grin, she left her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Julia turned pale at the very thought of the task she had to perform.
She opened the great book, and saw all the pages closely written, but
in the most confused manner possible. Here was, “Paid Mr. Crusty
for a week’s bread and baking” so much. Then, “Paid Mr. Pinchtoe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>for shoes,” so much. “Paid half a year’s rent,” so much. Then came
a butcher’s bill, succeeded by a milliner’s, and that by a tallow-chandler’s.
“What shall I do?” cried poor Juliet—“where am I to begin, and how
can I possibly pick out all these things? Was ever such a tedious, perplexing
task? O that my good little creature were here again with her
wand!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She had but just uttered these words when the fairy Order stood before
her. “Don’t be startled, my dear,” said she; “I knew your wish, and
made haste to comply with it. Let me see your book.” She turned
over a few leaves, and then cried, “I see my crossgrained sister has
played you a trick. She has brought you the <em>daybook</em> instead of the
<em>leger</em>; but I will set the matter to rights instantly.” She vanished,
and presently returned with another book, in which she showed Juliet
every one of the articles required, standing at the tops of the pages, and
all the particulars entered under them from the daybook; so that there
was nothing for her to do but cast up the sums, and copy out the heads
with their amount in single lines. As Juliet was a ready accountant, she
was not long in finishing the business, and produced her account neatly
written on one sheet of paper, at dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day, Juliet’s tormentor brought her up a large box full of
letters stamped upon small bits of ivory, capitals and common letters of
all sorts, but jumbled together promiscuously, as if they had been shaken
in a bag. “Now, miss,” said she, “before you come down to dinner, you
must exactly copy out this poem in these ivory letters, placing them line
by line on the floor of your room.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Juliet thought at first that this task would be pretty sport enough; but
when she set about it, she found such trouble in hunting out the letters
she wanted, every one seeming to come to hand before the right one, that
she proceeded very slowly; and the poem being a long one, it was plain
that night would come before it was finished. Sitting down and crying
for her kind friend was, therefore, her only resource.</p>

<p class='c000'>Order was not far distant, for, indeed, she had been watching her
proceedings all the while. She made herself visible, and giving a tap
on the letters with her wand, they immediately arranged themselves
alphabetically in little double heaps, the small in one, and the great in
the other. After this operation, Juliet’s task went on with such expedition,
that she called up the old lady an hour before dinner, to be witness
to its completion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The good lady kissed her, and told her, that as she hoped she was now
made fully sensible of the benefits of order, and the inconveniences of
disorder, she would not confine her any longer to work by herself at set
tasks, but she should come and sit with her. Juliet took such pains to
please her, by doing everything with the greatest neatness and regularity,
and reforming all her careless habits, that when she was sent back to her
mother, the following presents were made her, constantly to remind her
of the beauty and advantage of order:—</p>

<p class='c000'>A cabinet of English coins, in which all the gold and silver money of
the kings was arranged in the order of their reigns.</p>

<p class='c000'>A set of plaster casts of the Roman emperors.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cabinet of beautiful shells, displayed according to the most approved
system.</p>

<p class='c000'>A very complete box of water-colours, and another of crayons, sorted
in all the shades of the primary colours.</p>

<p class='c000'>And a very nice housewife, with all the implements belonging to a
seamstress, and a good store of the best needles in sizes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>LIVE DOLLS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. Lacour was accustomed to lay out for her daughter, a girl about
eight years old, a great deal of money in playthings. One morning Eliza
(that was her name) was in raptures over a new wax-doll, which her
mamma had given two guineas for in Fleet street. By means of a
concealed wire, it had been made to open and shut its eyes, to the no small
surprise of the little girl, not unmixed with a certain degree of terror,
when her mother first exhibited the phenomenon; but having had the
principle explained to her, she had spent the greatest part of the morning
in moving the wires up and down, and making them alternately open and
shut the eyelids. It is true the mechanism had one defect, which we
record, in hopes that the ingenuity of future doll-makers may find a
remedy for it. The doll shut her eyes after the manner of a bird, by drawing
up the membrane over the eye, instead of letting the eyelid fall over
it, as is the custom in human creatures; but as Eliza had not studied
comparative anatomy, this slight irregularity was not noticed. She was
still in raptures over her new acquisition, when she was surprised by a
visit from Mrs. Dorcas, a maiden sister of her father, who sometimes
called upon her. “Look here, my dear aunt,” said she, “what a charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>doll I have got; see, now its eyes are shut, now they are open again—how
curious! I dare say you cannot guess how I do it. I can hardly
help fancying it alive. To-morrow I shall begin to dress it, for it must
have a fine worked cap, with a laced border, and a long muslin robe and
shoes. I do not know whether it should have shoes yet, for it is only a
baby; and I shall lay it in the cradle, and rock it; and when I want it
to go to sleep, its eyes shall be shut, and in the morning they shall be open
again, just as if it were really alive: I wish it could eat and drink—why
could they not make its mouth to open?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> Your doll is very pretty, indeed, and I commend you for
intending to make its clothes yourself, but would not you like better to
have a real live doll to dress?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliza.</em> O yes! that I should, indeed; but I believe—I am afraid there
is no such doll.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> I will find you such a one if you will dress it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliza.</em> And will it open its mouth and eat?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> Yes, it will.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliza.</em> And can it speak, too?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> I do not say it can speak yet; it has not been taught; but
you shall hear its voice, and you shall see it breathe; your doll does not
breathe. [Eliza took her doll and placed her hand upon its waxen bosom,
as if she expected to feel it heave.] And the clothes you will make will
warm it too. A wax-doll is not warmed by its clothes. Your doll is as
cold when she is wrapped up in a quilt and placed in the cradle as if she
were laid naked upon a marble slab.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliza.</em> Is she?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> Yes; you may convince yourself of that whenever you
please; but this live doll will not only be warmed by the clothes you make,
but perhaps she may die if you do not make them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliza.</em> O! do not let her die—I will set about making the clothes
directly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> Then come along with me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eliza sallied forth with her aunt Dorcas: she was all the way silent,
and breathless with expectation. After leading her through a few streets,
her aunt stopped at a house, and asked to be shown into the workroom.
It was a room where a number of young girls were sitting at a long table,
with cheerful and busy looks. The table was covered with workbags,
needlecases, thread-papers, and such like sewing implements, and spread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>with flannel, calico, dimity, and old linen; one of the girls was making a
cap, another a petticoat, a third a frock—the elder ones were cutting out
the cloth—some of the little ones were stretching out their hands to hold
a skein of thread for the others to wind; not one was unemployed.
“What are they all doing?” said Eliza.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> They are all working for live dolls.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliza.</em> But where are the dolls?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> You cannot see them yet; they would suffer if the clothes
were not prepared for them before they came.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliza.</em> But here are no laces nor worked muslins; here is nothing
very pretty.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. D.</em> No, because pretty things seldom have the property of keeping
the wearers warm.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliza.</em> But who are they working for?</p>

<p class='c000'>At that instant, a woman, with a child upon her bosom, pale, but with
a countenance shining with joy and gratitude, entered the workroom,
pouring out her thanks to the good young ladies, as she truly called them,
for their well-timed bounty. “But for you,” she said, “this dear little
infant might perhaps have perished, or at least its little limbs would have
been chilled with cold for want of good and substantial clothing. My
husband was ill, and could not work, and I had no money to buy anything
but necessary food. If I could have bought the materials, or if you
had given them me, I could not have cut them out and contrived them,
and made them up myself: for I was never taught to be handy at my
needle as you have been, ladies. I was only set to coarse work. Look
what a sweet little infant it is, and how comfortable he looks. God bless
you, dear ladies! and make you all happy wives and mothers, when the
time comes!” The girls, with great pleasure, rose when she had finished
her address to them; and after congratulating the mother, took the infant,
and handing it from one to another, kissed and played with it. Eliza,
too, advanced, but timidly, and as if she had not yet earned a right to
caress it. “Approach, my niece,” said Mrs. Dorcas, “kiss the lips of
this infant, and imbibe that affection which is one of the characteristics
of your sex. Women are made to love children, and they should begin
to love them while they themselves are children; nor is there any surer
way of learning to love a being, than by doing good to it. You see now
why I brought you hither. This is the live doll I promised you; its
limbs are not the work of a clumsy mechanic, they are fashioned by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>consummate wisdom and skill, and it will not always remain as it is:
this little frame has a principle of improvement in it—it has powers that
will unfold themselves by degrees—the limbs will stretch and grow;
after a while it will walk, it will speak, it will play, it will be like one of
you. How precious then is the life of such a creature! But it has pleased
the Creator of all things that this excellent being should come into the
world naked and helpless; it has neither hair, nor wool, nor fur, nor
feathers to keep it warm; if not clothed and cherished, it would soon be
killed with the cold. It is, therefore, very desirable to help those poor
people who cannot afford to clothe their infants, lest so admirable a work
of God as a human creature should perish for want of care. There is a
great deal of pain and danger in bearing children in any situation of life;
but when people are poor as well as sick, the distress is very much
increased. These good young ladies, Eliza, have formed a society
among themselves for making baby-linen for the poor. Nobody bid them
do it; it was entirely of their own accord. They have agreed to subscribe
a penny a week out of their little pocket-money. A penny is a
very small matter; girls who have a great deal of money perhaps would
not suppose it worth thinking about, but a great many pennies every
week will in time come to a sum that is not so contemptible. With this
they buy the materials, such as warm flannels, coarse printed cottons,
and dimity. Their mammas give them, every now and then, some fine
old linen and cast-off clothes; but the value of their work is a great deal
more than that of the materials: if they did not cut and contrive, and
make them up, they would be of little service comparatively to the poor
people; besides, the doing so will make them clever managers when they
come to have children of their own. None of these good girls are above
fourteen; and they have clothed a number of little helpless infants, and
made, as you have seen, the mothers’ hearts very glad. Now, if you
wish it, I dare say they will let you work with them; but here is no
finery, and if you like better to work for your wax-doll, do so.”—“O, no!”
said Eliza, “the live doll for me;” and she bespoke a place at the long
worktable.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE HOG AND OTHER ANIMALS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A debate once arose among the animals in a farmyard, which of them
was most valued by their common master. After the horse, the ox, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>cow, the sheep, and the dog, had stated their several pretensions, the hog
took up the discourse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is plain,” said he, “that the greatest value must be set upon that
animal which is kept most for his own sake, without expecting from him
any return of use and service. Now, which of you can boast so much in
that respect as I can?</p>

<p class='c000'>“As for you, horse, though you are very well fed and lodged, and have
servants to attend upon you, and make you sleek and clean, yet all this is
for the sake of your labour. Do not I see you taken out early every
morning, put in chains, or fastened to the shafts of a heavy cart, and not
brought back till noon; when, after a short respite, you are taken to work
again till late in the evening? I may say just the same to the ox, except
that he works for poorer fare.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For you, Mrs. Cow, who are so dainty over your chopped straw and
grains, you are thought worth keeping only for your milk, which is drained
from you twice a day to the last drop, while your poor young ones are
taken from you, and sent I know not whither.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You, poor innocent sheep, who are turned out to shift for yourselves
upon the bare hills, or penned upon the fallows with now and then a
withered turnip or some musty hay, you pay dearly enough for your keep
by resigning your warm coat every year, for want of which you are liable
to be frozen to death on some of the cold nights before summer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As for the dog, who prides himself so much on being admitted to our
master’s table, and made his companion, that he will scarce condescend
to reckon himself one of us, he is obliged to do all the offices of a domestic
servant by day, and to keep watch during the night, while we are quietly
asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In short, you are all of you creatures maintained for use—poor subservient
things, made to be enslaved or pillaged. I, on the contrary,
have a warm stye and plenty of provisions all at free cost. I have nothing
to do but grow fat and follow my amusement; and my master is best
pleased when he sees me lying at ease in the sun, or filling my belly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus argued the hog, and put the rest to silence by so much logic and
rhetoric. This was not long before winter set in. It proved a very
scarce season for fodder of all kinds; so that the farmer began to consider
how he was to maintain all his live stock till spring. “It will be
impossible for me,” thought he, “to keep them all; I must therefore part
with those I can best spare. As for my horses and working oxen, I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>have business enough to employ them; they must be kept, cost what it
will. My cows will not give me much milk in the winter, but they will
calve in the spring, and be ready for the new grass. I must not lose the
profit of my dairy. The sheep, poor things, will take care of themselves
as long as there is a bite upon the hills; and if deep snow comes, we
must do with them as well as we can by the help of a few turnips and
some hay, for I must have their wool at shearing-time to make out my
rent with. But my hogs will eat me out of house and home, without
doing me any good. They must go to pot, that’s certain; and the sooner
I get rid of the fat ones, the better.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So saying, he singled out the orator as one of the prime among them,
and sent him to the butcher the very next day.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE BULLIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As young Francis was walking through a village with his tutor, they
were annoyed by two or three cur-dogs, that came running after them
with looks of the utmost fury, snarling and barking as if they would tear
their throats, and seeming every moment ready to fly upon them. Francis
every now and then stopped and shook his stick at them, or stooped down
to pick up a stone, upon which the curs retreated as fast as they came; but
as soon as he turned about, they were after his heels again. This lasted
till they came to a farmyard, through which their road lay. A large mastiff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>was lying down in it at his ease in the sun. Francis was almost afraid
to pass him, and kept as close to his tutor as possible. However, the dog
took not the least notice of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently, they came upon a common, where, going near a flock of
geese, they were assailed with hissings, and pursued some way by these
foolish birds, which, stretching out their long necks, made a very ridiculous
figure. Francis only laughed at them, though he was tempted to
give the foremost a switch across his neck. A little further was a herd
of cows with a bull among them, upon which Francis looked with some
degree of apprehension; but they kept quietly grazing, and did not take
their heads from the ground as he passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a lucky thing,” said Francis to his tutor, “that mastiffs and bulls
are not so quarrelsome as curs and geese; but what can be the reason
of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The reason,” replied the tutor, “is, that paltry and contemptible
animals, possessing no confidence in their own strength and courage, and
knowing themselves liable to injury from most of those that come in their
way, think it safer to take the part of bullies, and to make a show of
attacking those of whom in reality they are afraid: whereas, animals
which are conscious of force sufficient for their own protection, suspecting
no evil designs from others, entertain none themselves, but maintain
dignified composure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thus you will find it among mankind. Weak, mean, petty characters
are suspicious, snarling, and petulant. They raise an outcry against their
superiors in talents and reputation, of whom they stand in awe, and put
on airs of defiance and insolence through mere cowardice. But the truly
great are calm and inoffensive. They fear no injury, and offer none.
They even suffer slight attacks to go unnoticed, conscious of their power
to right themselves whenever the occasion shall seem to require it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE TRAVELLED ANT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There was a garden enclosed with high brick walls, and laid out
somewhat in the old fashion. Under the walls were wide beds planted
with flowers, garden-stuff, and fruit-trees. Next to them was a broad
gravel-walk running round the garden; and the middle was laid out in
grass-plots, and beds of flowers and shrubs with a fish-pond in the centre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the root of one of the wall fruit-trees, a numerous colony of ants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>was established, which had extended its subterraneous works over great
part of the bed in its neighbourhood. One day, two of the inhabitants,
meeting in a gallery under ground, fell into the following conversation:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ha! my friend,” said the first, “is it you? I am glad to see you.
Where have you been this long time? All your acquaintance have been
in pain about you, lest some accident should have befallen you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why,” replied the other, “I am, indeed, a sort of stranger, for you
must know I am but just returned from a long journey.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A journey! whither, pray, and on what account?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A tour of mere curiosity. I had long felt dissatisfied with knowing
so little about this world of ours; so, at length, I took a resolution to
explore it. And I may now boast that I have gone round its utmost
extremities, and that no considerable part of it has escaped my
researches.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wonderful! What a traveller you have been, and what sights you
must have seen!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, yes—I have seen more than most ants, to be sure; but it has
been at the expense of so much toil and danger, that I know not whether
it was worth the pains.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you oblige me with some account of your adventures?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Willingly: I set out, then, early one sunshiny morning; and, after
crossing our territory and the line of plantation by which it is bordered;
I came upon a wide open plain, where, as far as the eye could reach, not
a single green thing was to be descried, but the hard soil was everywhere
covered with huge stones, which made travelling equally painful to the
eye and the feet. As I was toiling onward, I heard a rumbling noise
behind me, which became louder and louder. I looked back, and with
the utmost horror beheld a prodigious rolling mountain approaching me
so fast that it was impossible to get out of the way. I threw myself flat
on the ground behind a stone, and lay expecting nothing but present death.
The mountain soon passed over me, and I continued (I know not how
long) in a state of insensibility. When I recovered, I began to stretch
my limbs one by one, and, to my surprise, found myself not in the least
injured! but the stone beside me was almost buried in the earth by the
crash!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What an escape!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A wonderful one, indeed. I journeyed on over the desert, and at
length came to the end of it, and entered upon a wide green tract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>consisting chiefly of tall, narrow, pointed leaves, which grew so thick
and entangled, that it was with the greatest difficulty I could make my
way between them; and I should continually have lost my road, had I
not taken care to keep the sun in view before me. When I had got near
the middle of this region, I was startled with the sight of a huge four-legged
monster, with a yellow speckled skin, which took a flying leap
directly over me. Somewhat farther, before I was aware, I ran upon one
of those long, round, crawling creatures, without head, tail, or legs, which
we sometimes meet with under ground, near our settlement. As soon as
he felt me upon him, he drew back into his hole so swiftly, that he was
near drawing me in along with him. However, I jumped off, and proceeded
on my way.</p>

<p class='c000'>“With much labour I got, at last, to the end of this perplexed tract, and
came to an open space like that in which we live, in the midst of which grew
trees so tall that I could not see to their tops. Being hungry, I climbed
the first I came to, in expectation of finding some fruit; but after a
weary search I returned empty. I tried several others with no better
success. There were, indeed, leaves and flowers in plenty, but nothing
of which I could make a meal; so that I might have been famished, had I
not found some sour harsh berries upon the ground, on which I made a
poor repast. While I was doing this, a greater danger than any of the
former befell me. One of those two-legged feathered creatures, which we
often see to our cost, jumped down from a bough, and picked up in his
enormous beak the very berry on which I was standing. Luckily, he did
not swallow it immediately, but flew up again with it to the tree; and, in
the meantime, I disengaged myself, and fell from a vast height to the
ground, but received no hurt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I crossed this plantation, and came to another entangled green like the
first. After I had laboured through it, I came on a sudden to the side of
a vast glittering plain, the nature of which I could not possibly guess at.
I walked along a fallen leaf which lay on the side, and coming to the
farther edge of it, I was greatly surprised to see another ant coming from
below to meet me. I advanced to give him a fraternal embrace; but
instead of what I expected, I met a cold yielding matter, in which I
should have sunk, had I not speedily turned about, and caught hold of
the leaf, by which I drew myself up again. And now I found this great
plain to consist of that fluid which sometimes falls from the sky, and causes
so much trouble by filling our holes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“As I stood considering how to proceed on my journey, a gentle breeze
arose, which, before I was aware, carried the leaf I was upon away from
the solid land into this yielding fluid, which, however, bore it up and me
along with it. At first, I was greatly alarmed, and ran round and round
my leaf in order to find some way of getting back; but perceiving this to
be impracticable, I resigned myself to my fate, and even began to take
some pleasure in the easy motion by which I was borne forward. But
what new and wonderful forms of living creatures did I see inhabiting
this liquid land! Bodies of prodigious bulk, covered with shining scales
of various colours, shot by me with vast rapidity, and sported a thousand
ways. They had large heads and staring eyes, tremendous wide mouths,
but no legs; and they seemed to be carried on by the action of something
like small wings planted on various parts of the body, and especially at
the end of the tail, which continually waved about. Other smaller creatures,
of a great variety of extraordinary forms, were moving through the
clear fluid, or resting upon its surface; and I saw with terror numbers
of them continually seized and swallowed by the larger ones before-mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I had got near the middle, the smooth surface of this plain was
all roughened, and moved up and down, so as to toss about my leaf, and
nearly overset it. I trembled to think what would become of me, should
I be thrown amidst all these terrible monsters. At last, however, I got
safe to the other side, and with joy set my feet on dry land again. I
ascended a gentle green slope, which led to a tall plantation like that I had
before passed through. Another green plain, and another stony desert,
succeeded; which brought me, at length, to the opposite boundary of our
world, enclosed by the same immense mound rising to the heavens, which
limits us on this side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here I fell in with another nation of our species differing little in
way of life from ourselves. They invited me to their settlement, and
entertained me hospitably, and I accompanied them in several excursions
in the neighbourhood. There was a charming fruit-tree at no great
distance, to which we made frequent visits. One day as I was regaling
deliciously on the heart of a green-gage plum, I felt myself on a sudden
carried along with great swiftness, till I got into a dark place, where a
horrid crash threw me upon a soft moist piece of flesh, whence I was soon
driven forth in a torrent of wind and moisture, and found myself on the
ground all covered with slime. I disengaged myself with difficulty and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>looking up, descried one of those enormous two-legged animals, which
often shake the ground over our heads, and put us in terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My new friends now began to hint to me that it was time to depart,
‘for you know we are not fond of naturalizing strangers.’ And lucky,
indeed, it was for me that I received the hint when I did; for I had but
just left the place, and was travelling over a neighbouring eminence,
when I heard behind me a tremendous noise; and looking back I saw the
whole of their settlement blown into the air with a prodigious explosion of
fire and smoke. Numbers of half-burnt bodies, together with the ruins of
their habitations, were thrown to a vast distance around; and such a suffocating
vapour arose, that I lay for some time deprived of sense and motion.
From some of the wretched fugitives I learned that the disaster was
attributed to subterranean fire bursting its way to the surface: the cause of
which, however, was supposed to be connected with the machinations of
that malignant two-legged monster, from whose jaws I had so narrowly
escaped, who had been observed, just before the explosion, to pour through
the holes leading to the great apartment of the settlement, a number of
black shining grains.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On my return from this remote country, I kept along the boundary-wall,
which I knew by observation must at length bring me back to my
own home. I met with several wandering tribes of our species in my
road, and frequently joined their foraging parties in search of food. One
day, a company of us, allured by the smell of something sweet, climbed
some lofty pillars, on which was placed a vast round edifice, having
only one entrance. At this, were continually going in and coming out
those winged animals, somewhat like ourselves in form, but many times
bigger, and armed with a dreadful sting, which we so often meet with
sipping the juices of flowers; but whether they were the architects of this
great mansion, or it was built for them by some beneficent being of great
powers, I am unable to decide. It seemed, however, to be the place where
they deposited what they so industriously collect; for they were perpetually
arriving loaded with a fragrant substance, which they carried in, and
then returned empty. We had a great desire to enter with them, but
were deterred by their formidable appearance, and a kind of angry hum,
which continually proceeded from the house. At length two or three of the
boldest of our party, watching a time when the entrance was pretty free, ventured
to go in: but we soon saw them driven out in great haste, and trampled
down and massacred at the gateway. The rest of us made a speedy retreat.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Two more adventures which happened to me had very nearly prevented
my return to my own country. Having one evening, together
with a companion, taken up my quarters in an empty snail-shell, there
came on such a shower of rain in the night, that the shell was presently
filled. I awaked just suffocated; but, luckily, having my head turned
towards the mouth of the shell, I rose to the top, and made a shift to crawl
to a dry place. My companion, who had got farther into the shell, never
rose again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not long after, as I was travelling under the wall, I descried a curious
pit, with a circular orifice, gradually growing narrower to the bottom. On
coming close to the brink in order to survey it, the edge, which was of
fine sand, gave way and I slid down the pit. As soon as I had reached
the bottom, a creature with a huge pair of horns and dreadful claws made
his appearance from beneath the sand, and attempted to seize me. I flew
back, and ran up the side of the pit; when he threw over me such a
shower of sand as blinded me, and had like to have brought me down
again. However, by exerting all my strength, I got out of his reach, and
did not cease running till I was at a considerable distance. I was afterward
informed that this was the den of an antlion, a terrible foe of our
species, which, not equalling us in speed, is obliged to make use of this
crafty device to entrap his heedless prey.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This was the last of my perils. To my great joy, I reached my native
place last night, where I mean to stay content for the future. I do not
know how far I have benefited from my travels, but one important
conclusion I have drawn from them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is that?” said his friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, you know it is the current opinion with us, that everything in
this world was made for our use. Now, I have seen such vast tracts not
at all fit for our residence, and peopled with creatures so much larger and
stronger than ourselves, that I cannot help being convinced that the
Creator had in view their accommodation as well as ours, in making this
world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I confess this seems probable enough; but you had better keep your
opinion to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know we ants are a vain race, and make high pretensions to
wisdom as well as antiquity. We shall be affronted with any attempts
to lessen our importance in our own eyes.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“But there is no wisdom in being deceived.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well—do as you think proper. Meantime, farewell, and thanks for
the entertainment you have given me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Farewell!”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE COLONISTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Come,” said Mr. Barlow to his boys, “I have a new play for you.
I will be the founder of a colony; and you shall be people of different
trades and professions coming to offer yourselves to go with me. What
are you, <em>A.</em>?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> I am a farmer, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Very well! Farming is the chief thing we have to depend
upon, so we cannot have too much of it. But you must be a working
farmer, not a gentleman-farmer. Labourers will be scarce among us, and
every man must put his own hand to the plough. There will be woods
to clear, and marshes to drain, and a great deal of stubborn work to do.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> I shall be ready to do my part, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Well, then, I shall entertain you willingly, and as many more
of your profession as you can bring. You shall have land enough, and
utensils; and you may fall to work as soon as you please. Now for the
next.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>B.</em> I am a miller, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> A very useful trade! The corn we grow must be ground, or
it will do us little good. But what will you do for a mill, my friend?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>B.</em> I suppose we must make one, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> True; but then you must bring with you a millwright for the
purpose. As for millstones, we will take them out with us. Who is
next?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>C.</em> I am a carpenter, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> The most necessary man that could offer! We shall find
you work enough, never fear. There will be houses to build, fences to
make, and all kinds of wooden furniture to provide. But our timber is
all growing. You will have a great deal of hard work to do in felling
trees, and sawing planks, and shaping posts and the like. You must be
a field-carpenter as well as a house-carpenter.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>C.</em> I will, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Very well! then I engage you, but you had better bring two
or three able hands along with you.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><em>D.</em> I am a blacksmith, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> An excellent companion for the carpenter! We cannot do
without either of you; so you may bring your great bellows and anvil,
and we will set up a forge for you as soon as we arrive. But, by-the-by,
we shall want a mason for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>E.</em> I am one, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> That’s well. Though we may live in loghouses at first, we
shall want brick or stone work for chimneys, and hearths, and ovens; so
there will be employment for a mason. But if you can make bricks and
burn lime, too, you will be still more useful.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>E.</em> I will try what I can do, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> No man can do more. I engage you. Who is next?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>F.</em> I am a shoemaker, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> And shoes we cannot well do without. But can you make them,
like Eumæus in the Odyssey, out of a raw hide? for I fear we shall get
no leather.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>F.</em> But I can dress hides, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Can you?—then you are a clever fellow, and I will have
you, though I give you double wages.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>G.</em> I am a tailor, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Well—though it will be some time before we want holyday-suits,
yet we must not go naked; so there will be work for the tailor
But you are not above mending and botching, I hope, for we must not
mind patched clothes while we work in the woods.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>G.</em> I am not, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Then I engage you, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> I am a weaver, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Weaving is a very useful art, but I question if we can find
room for it in our colony for the present. We shall not grow either hemp
or flax for some time to come, and it will be cheaper for us to import our
cloth than to make it. In a few years, however, we may be very glad of
you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>J.</em> I am a silversmith and jeweller, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Then, my friend, you cannot go to a worse place than a
new colony to set up your trade in. You will break us, or we shall
starve you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>J.</em> But I understand clock and watch making, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> That is somewhat more to our purpose, for we shall want to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>know how time goes. But I doubt we cannot give you sufficient
encouragement for a long time to come. For the present you had better
stay where you are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> I am a barber and hairdresser, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Alas! what can we do with you? If you will shave our
men’s rough beards once a week, and crop their hair once a quarter, and
be content to help the carpenter, or follow the plough the rest of your
time, we shall reward you accordingly. But you will have no ladies and
gentlemen to dress for a ball, or wigs to curl and powder for Sundays, I
assure you. Your trade will not stand by itself with us for a great time
to come.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> I am a medical man, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Then, sir, you are very welcome. Health is the first of
blessings, and if you can give us that, you will be a valuable man indeed.
But I hope you understand surgery as well as physic, for we are likely
enough to get cuts and bruises, and broken bones occasionally.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> I have had experience in that branch too, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> And if you understand the nature of plants, and their uses
both in medicine and diet, it will be a great addition to your usefulness.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> Botany has been a favourite study with me, sir; and I have some
knowledge of chymistry, and the other parts of natural history, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Then you will be a treasure to us, sir, and I shall be happy
to make it worth your while to go with us.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> I, sir, am a lawyer.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Sir, your most obedient servant. When we are rich enough
to go to law, we will let you know.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>N.</em> I am a schoolmaster, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> That is a profession which I am sure I do not mean to undervalue;
and as soon as ever we have young folks in our colony, we shall
be glad of your services. Though we are to be hard-working, plain
people, we do not intend to be ignorant, and we shall make it a point to
have every one taught reading and writing, at least. In the meantime,
till we have employment enough for you in teaching, you may keep the
accounts and records of the colony: and on Sunday you may read prayers
to all those that choose to attend upon you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>N.</em> With all my heart, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Then I engage you. Who comes here with so bold an air?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>O.</em> I am a soldier, sir; will you have me?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span><em>Mr. B.</em> We are peaceable people, and I hope shall have no occasion
to fight. We mean honestly to purchase our land from the natives, and
to be just and fair in all our dealings with them. William Penn, the
founder of Pennsylvania followed that plan; and when the Indians were
at war with all the other European settlers, a person in a quaker’s habit
might pass through all their most ferocious tribes without the least injury.
It is my intention, however, to make all my colonists soldiers, so far as
to be able to defend themselves if attacked, and that being the case, we
shall have no need of <em>soldiers by trade</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>P.</em> I am a gentleman, sir; and I have a great desire to accompany
you, because I hear game is very plentiful in that country.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> A gentleman! And what good will you do us, sir?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>P.</em> O, sir, that is not at all my intention. I only mean to amuse
myself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> But do you mean, sir, that we should pay for your amusement?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>P.</em> As to maintenance, I expect to be able to kill game enough for
my own eating, with a little bread and garden-stuff, which you will give
me. Then I will be content with a house somewhat better than the
common ones; and your barber shall be my valet; so I shall give very
little trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> And pray, sir, what inducement can we have for doing all
this for you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>P.</em> Why, sir, you will have the credit of having <em>one gentleman</em> at
least in your colony.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Ha, ha, ha! A facetious gentleman, truly! Well, sir, when
we are ambitious of such a distinction, we will send for you.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE DOG AND HIS RELATIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Keeper was a farmer’s mastiff, honest, brave, and vigilant. One day,
as he was ranging at some distance from home, he espied a wolf and a
fox sitting together at the corner of a wood. Keeper, not much liking
their looks, though by no means fearing them, was turning another way,
when they called after him, and civilly desired him to stay, “Surely,
sir,” says Reynard, “you wo’n’t disown your relations. My cousin
Gaunt and I were just talking over family-matters, and we both agreed
that we had the honour of reckoning you among our kin. You must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>know that, according to the best accounts, the wolves and dogs were
originally one race in the forests of Armenia; but the dogs, taking to
living with man, have since become inhabitants of towns and villages,
while the wolves have retained their ancient mode of life. As to my
ancestors, the foxes, they were a branch of the same family, who settled
farther northward, where they became stinted in their growth, and
adopted the custom of living in holes under ground. The cold has
sharpened our noses, and given us a thicker fur and bushy tails to keep
us warm. But we have all a family likeness which it is impossible to
mistake; and I am sure it is our interest to be good friends with each
other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The wolf was of the same opinion; and Keeper, looking narrowly at
them, could not help acknowledging their relationship. As he had a
generous heart, he readily entered into friendship with them. They took
a ramble together; but Keeper was rather surprised at observing the
suspicious shyness with which some of the weaker sort of animals
surveyed them, and wondered at the hasty flight of a flock of sheep as
soon as they came within view. However, he gave his cousins a cordial
invitation to come and see him at his yard, and then took his leave.</p>

<p class='c000'>They did not fail to come the next day about dusk. Keeper received
them kindly, and treated them with part of his own supper. They stayed
with him till after dark, and then marched off with many compliments.
The next morning word was brought to the farm that a goose and three
goslings were missing, and that a couple of lambs were found almost
devoured in the home-field. Keeper was too honest himself readily to
suspect others, so he never thought of his kinsmen on the occasion. Soon
after, they paid him a second evening visit; and next day, another loss
appeared, of a hen and her chickens, and a fat sheep. Now Keeper could
not help mistrusting a little, and blamed himself for admitting strangers
without his master’s knowledge. However, he still did not love to think
ill of his own relations.</p>

<p class='c000'>They came a third time. Keeper received them rather coldly; and
hinted that he should like better to see them in the daytime; but they
excused themselves for want of leisure. When they took their leave he
resolved to follow at some distance and watch their motions. A litter
of young pigs happened to be lying under a haystack without the yard.
The wolf seized one by the back, and ran off with him. The pig set up
a most dismal squeal; and Keeper, running up at the noise, caught his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>dear cousin in the fact. He flew at him and made him relinquish his
prey, though not without much snarling and growling. The fox, who
had been prowling about the henroost, now came up, and began to make
protestations of his own innocence, with heavy reproaches against the
wolf for thus disgracing the family. “Begone, scoundrels both!” cried
Keeper; “I know you now too well. You may be of my blood, but I
am sure you are not of my spirit. Keeper holds no kindred with
villains.” So saying, he drove them from the premises.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF A CAT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Some days ago died <span class='sc'>Grimalkin</span>, the favourite tabby-cat of Mrs. Petlove.
Her disorder was a shortness of breath, proceeding partly from old age,
and partly from fat. As she felt her end approaching, she called her children
to her, and with a great deal of difficulty spoke as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Before I depart from this world, my children, I mean, if my breath
will give me leave, to relate to you the principal events of my life, as the
variety of scenes I have gone through may afford you some useful
instruction for avoiding those dangers to which our species are particularly
exposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Without further preface, then, I was born at a farmhouse, in a
village some miles hence; and almost as soon as I came into the world,
I was very near leaving it again. My mother brought five of us at
a litter; and as the frugal people of the house only kept cats to be useful,
and were already sufficiently stocked, we were immediately doomed to be
drowned; and accordingly, a boy was ordered to take us all and throw us
into the horsepond. This commission he performed with the pleasure
boys seem naturally to take in acts of cruelty, and we were presently set
a swimming. While we were struggling for life, a little girl, daughter to
the farmer, came running to the pond-side, and begged very hard that she
might save one of us, and bring him up for her own. After some dispute
her request was granted; and the boy, reaching out his arm, took hold of
me, who was luckily nearest him, and brought me out when I was just
spent. I was laid on the grass, and it was some time before I recovered.
The girl then restored me to my mother, who was overjoyed to get again
one of her little ones; and for fear of another mischance, she took me in
her mouth to a dark hole, where she kept me till I could see, and was able
to run by her side. As soon as I came to light again, my little mistress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>took possession of me, and tended me very carefully. Her fondness,
indeed, was sometimes troublesome, as she pinched my sides with carrying
me, and once or twice hurt me a good deal by letting me fall. Soon,
however, I became strong and active, and played and gambolled all day
long, to the great delight of my mistress and her companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At this time I had another narrow escape. A man brought into the
house a strange dog, who had been taught to worry all the cats that came
in his way. My mother slunk away at his entrance; but I, thinking, like
a little fool as I was, that I was able to protect myself, stayed on the floor,
growling, and setting up my back by way of defiance. The dog instantly
ran at me, and before I could get my claws ready, seized me with his
mouth, and began to gripe and shake me most terribly. I screamed out,
and, by good luck, my mistress was within hearing. She ran to us, but
was not able to disengage me; however, a servant, seeing her distress
took a great stick, and gave the dog such a bang on the back, that he was
forced to let me go. He had used me so roughly, that I was not able
to stand for some time; but by care and a good constitution I recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was now running after everybody’s heels, by which means I got
one day locked up in the dairy. I was not sorry for this accident, thinking
to feast upon the cream and other good things. But having climbed
a shelf to get at a bowl of cream, I unluckily fell backward into a large
vessel of buttermilk, where I should probably have been drowned, had
not the maid heard the noise, and come to see what was the matter. She
took me out, scolding bitterly at me, and after making me undergo a
severe discipline at the pump to clean me, she dismissed me with a good
whipping. I took care not to follow her into the dairy again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After a while I began to get into the yard, and my mother took me into
the barn on a mousing expedition. I shall never forget the pleasure this
gave me. We sat by a hole, and presently out came a mouse with a brood
of young ones. My mother darted among them, and first demolished the old
one, and then pursued the little ones, who ran about squeaking in dreadful
perplexity. I now thought it was time for me to do something, and accordingly
ran after a straggler, and soon overtook it. O, how proud was I, as I
stood over my trembling captive, and patted him with my paws! My
pride, however, soon met with a check; for seeing one day a large rat
I courageously flew at him; but instead of running from me, he gave me
such a bite on the nose, that I ran away to my mother mewing piteously,
with my face all bloody and swelled. For some time I did not meddle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>with rats again; but at length, growing stronger and more skilful, I feared
neither rats nor any other vermin, and acquired the reputation of an
excellent hunter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had some other escapes about this time. Once I happened to meet
with some poisoned food laid for the rats, and eating it, I was thrown
into a disorder that was very near killing me. At another time, I chanced
to set my foot in a rat-trap, and received so many deep wounds from its
teeth, that though I was loosened as gently as possible by the people who
heard me cry, I was rendered lame for some weeks after.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Time went on, and I arrived at my full growth; and forming an
acquaintance with a male-cat about my age, after a decent resistance by
scolding, biting, and scratching, we made a match of it. I became a
mother in due time, and had the mortification of seeing several broods of
my kittens disposed of in the same manner as my brothers and sisters
had been. I shall mention two or three more adventures in the order I
remember them. I was once prowling for birds along a hedge at some
distance from home, when the ‘squire’s grayhounds came that way a
coursing. As soon as they spied me, they set off full speed, and running
much faster than I could do, were just behind me, when I reached a tree,
and saved myself by climbing it. But a greater danger befell me on
meeting with a parcel of boys returning from school. They surrounded
me before I was aware, and obliged me to take refuge in a tree; but I soon
found that a poor defence against such enemies; for they assembled about
it, and threw stones on all sides, so that I could not avoid receiving many
hard blows, one of which brought me senseless to the ground. The
biggest boy now seized me, and proposed to the rest making what he
called rare sport with me. This sport was to tie me to a board, and
launching me on a pond, to set some water-dogs at me, who were to duck
and half drown me, while I was to defend myself by biting their noses,
and scratching their eyes. Already was I bound, and just ready to be set
a sailing when the schoolmaster taking a walk that way, and seeing the
bustle, came up, and obliged the boys to set me at liberty, severely
reprimanding them for their cruel intentions.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The next remarkable incident of my life was the occasion of my
removal from the country. My mistress’s brother had a tame linnet,
of which he was very fond; for it would come and light on his shoulder
when he called for it, and feed out of his hand; and it sung well besides.
This bird was usually either in its cage or upon a high perch; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>one unlucky day, when he and I were alone in the room together, he
came down on the table to pick up crumbs. I spied him, and not being
able to resist the temptation, sprung at him, and catching him in my
claws, soon began to devour him. I had almost finished when his
master came into the room; and seeing me with the remains of poor
linnet in my mouth, he ran to me in the greatest fury, and after chasing
me several times round the room, at length caught me. He was proceeding
instantly to hang me, when his sister, by many entreaties and tears,
persuaded him, after a good whipping, to forgive me, upon the promise
that I should be sent away. Accordingly, the next market-day I was
despatched in the cart to a relation of theirs in this town, who wanted
a good cat, as the house was overrun with mice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the service of this family I continued a good while, performing my
duty as a mouser extremely well, so that I was in high esteem. I soon
became acquainted with all the particulars of a town life, and distinguished
my activity in climbing walls and houses, and jumping from roof to
roof, either in pursuit of prey, or upon gossiping parties with my companions.
Once, however, I had like to have suffered for my venturing;
for having made a great jump from one house to another, I lit upon a
loose tile, which giving way with me, I fell from a vast height into the
street, and should certainly have been killed, had I not had the luck to
light in a dung-cart, whence I escaped with no other injury but being
half stifled with filth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Notwithstanding the danger I had run from killing the linnet, I am
sorry to confess that I was again guilty of a similar offence. I contrived
one night to leap down from a roof upon the board of some pigeon-holes,
which led to a garret inhabited by those birds. I entered, and finding
them asleep, made sad havoc among all that were within my reach,
killing and sucking the blood of near a dozen. I was near paying dearly
for this, too; for on attempting to return, I found it was impossible for me
to leap up again to the place whence I had descended, so that, after several
dangerous trials, I was obliged to wait trembling in the place where I
had committed all these murders, till the owner came up in the morning
to feed his pigeons. I rushed out between his legs as soon as the door
was opened, and had the good fortune to get safe down stairs, and make
my escape through a window unknown; but never shall I forget the
horrors I felt that night! Let my double danger be a warning to you,
my children, to control your savage appetites, and on no account to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>harm to those creatures which, like ourselves, are under the protection of
man. We cats all lie under a bad name for treacherous dispositions in
this respect, and with shame I must acknowledge it is but too well
merited.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well—but my breath begins to fail me, and I must hasten to a conclusion.
I still lived in the same family, when our present kind mistress,
Mrs. Petlove, having lost a favourite tabby, advertised a very handsome
price for another, that should as nearly as possible resemble her dead
darling. My owners, tempted by the offer, took me for the good lady’s
inspection, and I had the honour of being preferred to a multitude of rivals.
I was immediately settled in the comfortable mansion we now inhabit,
and had many favours and indulgences bestowed upon me, such as I
had never before experienced. Among these I reckon one of the principal
that of being allowed to rear all my children, and to see them grow up
in peace and plenty. My adventures here have been few; for after the
monkey had spitefully bit off the last joint of my tail, (for which I had the
satisfaction to see him soundly corrected,) I kept beyond the length of
his chain; and neither the parrot nor lapdogs ever dared to molest me.
One of the greatest afflictions I have felt here was the stifling of a whole
litter of my kittens by a fat old lady, a friend of my mistress, who sat
down on the chair where they lay, and never perceived the mischief she
was doing till she rose, though I pulled her clothes and used all the
means in my power to show my uneasiness. This misfortune my mistress
took to heart almost as much as myself, and the lady has never since
entered our doors. Indeed, both I and mine had ever been treated here
with the utmost kindness—perhaps with too much; for, to the pampering
me with delicacies, together with Mrs. Abigail’s frequent washings, I
attribute this asthma, which is now putting an end to my life rather
sooner than its natural period. But I know all was meant well; and
with my last breath I charge you all to show your gratitude to our
worthy mistress, by every return in your power.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And now, my dear children, farewell; we shall perhaps meet again
in a land where there are no dogs to worry us, or boys to torment us—Adieu!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus said, Grimalkin became speechless, and presently departed
this life, to the great grief of all the family.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>Scene—<em>The seaside, near Southampton. The tide coming in.</em></h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Canute.</em> Is it true, my friends, what you have so often told me, that
I am the greatest of monarchs?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Offa.</em> It is true, my liege; you are the most powerful of all kings.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Oswald.</em> We are all your slaves; we kiss the dust of your feet.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Offa.</em> Not only we, but even the elements, are your slaves. The
land obeys you from shore to shore; and the sea obeys you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Canute.</em> Does the sea, with its loud boisterous waves, obey me?
Will that terrible element be still at my bidding?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Offa.</em> Yes, the sea is yours; it was made to bear your ships upon its
bosom, and to pour the treasures of the world at your royal feet. It is
boisterous to your enemies, but it knows you to be its sovereign.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Canute.</em> Is not the tide coming up?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Oswald.</em> Yes, my liege; you may perceive the swell already.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Canute.</em> Bring me a chair, then; set it here upon the sands.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Offa.</em> Where the tide is coming up, my gracious lord?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Canute.</em> Yes, set it just here.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Oswald</em> (<em>aside</em>). I wonder what he is going to do!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Offa</em> (<em>aside</em>). Surely, he is not such a fool as to believe us!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Canute.</em> O, mighty ocean! thou art my subject: my courtiers tell me
so; and it is thy bounden duty to obey me. Thus, then, I stretch my
sceptre over thee, and command thee to retire. Roll back thy swelling
waves, nor let them presume to wet the feet of me, thy royal master.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Oswald</em> (<em>aside</em>). I believe the sea will pay very little regard to his
royal commands.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Offa.</em> See how fast the tide rises!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Oswald.</em> The next wave will come up to the chair. It is folly to
stay; we shall be covered with salt water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Canute.</em> Well, does the sea obey my commands? If it be my subject,
it is a very rebellious subject. See how it swells and dashes the angry
foam and salt spray over my sacred person. Vile sycophants! did you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>think I was the dupe of your base lies? that I believed your abject
flatteries? Know, there is only one Being whom the sea will obey. He
is sovereign of heaven and earth, King of kings, and Lord of lords. It is
only he who can say to the ocean—“Thus far shalt thou go, but no
farther, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.” A king is but a
man; and a man is but a worm. Shall a worm assume the power of the
great God, and think the elements will obey him? Take away this
crown, I will never wear it more. May kings learn to be humble from
my example, and courtiers learn truth from your disgrace.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>DIALOGUE, ON THINGS TO BE LEARNED,<br /> BETWEEN MAMMA AND KITTY.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><em>Kitty.</em> Pray, mamma, may I leave off working? I am tired.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mamma.</em> You have done very little, my dear; you know you were
to finish all that hem.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> But I had rather write now, mamma, or read, or get my French
grammar.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> I know very well what that means, Kitty; you had rather do
anything than what I set you about.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> No, mamma; but you know I can work very well already, and I
have a great many more things to learn. There’s Miss Rich that cannot
sew half so well as I, and she is learning music and drawing already,
besides dancing, and I don’t know how many other things. She tells
me that they hardly work at all in their school.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Your tongue runs at a great rate, my dear; but, in the first place,
you cannot sew very well for if you could, you would not have been so
long in doing this little piece. Then I hope you will allow that mammas
know better what is proper for their little girls to learn than they do
themselves?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> To be sure, mamma; but as I suppose I must learn all these
things some time or other, I thought you would like to have me begin
them soon, for I have often heard you say that children cannot be set too
early about what is necessary for them to do.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> That’s very true; but all things are not equally necessary to every
one; for some that are very fit for one, are scarcely proper at all for
others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Why, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><em>M.</em> Because, my dear, it is the purpose of all education to fit persons
for the station in which they are hereafter to live; and you know there
are very great differences in that respect, both among men and women.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Are there? I thought all <em>ladies</em> lived alike.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> It is usual to call all well-educated women, who have no occasion
to work for their livelihood, <em>ladies</em>; but, if you will think a little, you
must see that they live very differently from each other, for their fathers
and husbands are in very different ranks and situations in the world, you
know.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Yes, I know that some are lords, and some are ‘squires, and some
are clergymen, and some are merchants, and some are doctors, and some
are shopkeepers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Well: and do you think the wives and daughters of these persons
can have just the same things to do, and the same duties to perform?
You know how I spend my time. I have to go to market and provide
for the family, to look after the servants, to help in taking care of you
children, and in teaching you to see that your clothes are in proper
condition, and assist in making and mending for myself, and you, and
your papa. All this is my necessary duty; and besides this, I must go
out a visiting to keep up our acquaintance; this I call partly business,
and partly amusement. Then when I am tired, and have done all that I
think necessary, I may amuse myself with reading, or in any other
proper way. Now a great many of these employments do not belong to
Lady Wealthy, or Mrs. Rich, who keep housekeepers and governesses,
and servants of all kinds, to do everything for them. It is very proper,
therefore, for them to pay more attention to music, drawing, ornamental
work, and any other elegant manner of passing their time and making
themselves agreeable.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> And shall I have all the same things to do, mamma, that you have?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> It is impossible, my dear, to foresee what your future station will
be; but you have no reason to expect that if you have a family you will
have fewer duties to perform than I have. This is the way of life for
which your education should prepare you; and everything will be useful
and important for you to learn, in proportion as it will make you fit for this.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> But when I am grown a young lady, shall I not have to visit, and
go to assemblies and plays, as Miss Wilsons and Miss Johnsons do?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> It is very likely you may enter into some amusement of this sort:
but even then you will have several more serious employments, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>will take up a much greater part of your time; and if you do not do them
properly, you will have no right to partake of the others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> What will they be, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Why, don’t you think it proper that you should assist me in my
household affairs a little, as soon as you are able?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> O yes, mamma, I should be very glad to do that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Well, consider what talents will be necessary for that purpose;
will not a good hand at your needle be one of the very first qualities?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> I believe it will.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Yes, and not only in assisting <em>me</em>, but in making things for <em>yourself</em>.
You know how we admired Miss Smart’s ingenuity when she
was with us, in contriving and making so many articles of her dress, for
which she must otherwise have gone to the milliner’s, which would have
cost a great deal of money.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Yes; she made my pretty bonnet, and she made you a very handsome
cap.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Very true; she was so clever as not only to furnish herself with
these things, but to oblige her friends with some of her work. And I dare
say she does a great deal of plain work also for herself and her mother.
Well, then, you are convinced of the importance of this business, I hope.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Yes, mamma.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Reading and writing are such necessary parts of education, that I
need not say much to you about them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> O no, for I love reading dearly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> I know you do, if you can get entertaining stories to read, but
there are many things also to be read for instruction, which perhaps may
not be so pleasant at first.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> But what need is there of so many books of this sort?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Some are to teach you your duty to your Maker, and your fellow-creatures,
of which I hope you are sensible you ought not to be ignorant.
Then it is very right to be acquainted with geography; for you remember
how poor Miss Blunder was laughed at for saying that if ever she went
to France, it should be by land.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> That was because England is an island, and all surrounded with
water, was it not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Yes, Great Britain, which contains both England and Scotland,
is an island. Well, it is very useful to knew something of the nature of
plants, and animals, and minerals, because we are always using some or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>other of them. Something, too, of the heavenly bodies is very proper to
be known, both that we may admire the power and wisdom of God in
creating them, and that we may not make foolish mistakes, when their
natures and properties are the subject of conversation. The knowledge of
history too, is very important, especially that of our own country; and in
short, everything that makes part of the discourse of rational and well-educated
people, ought in some degree to be studied by every one who has
proper opportunities.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Yes, I like some of those things very well. But pray, mamma,
what do I learn French for—am I ever to live in France?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Probably not, my dear; but there are a great many books written
in French that are very well worth reading; and it may every now and
then happen that you may be in company with foreigners who cannot
speak English, and as they almost all talk French, you may be able to
converse with them in that language.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Yes, I remember there was a gentleman here that came from
Germany, I think, and he could hardly speak a word of English, but papa
and you could talk to him in French; and I wished very much to be able
to understand what you were saying, for I believe part of it was about me.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> It was. Well, then, you see the use of French. But I cannot
say this is a <em>necessary</em> part of knowledge to young women in general,
only it is well worth acquiring, if a person has leisure and opportunity.
I will tell you, however, what is quite necessary for one in your station,
and that is, to write a good hand, and to cast accounts well.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> I should like to write well, because then I should send letters to
my friends when I pleased, and it would not be such a scrawl as our
maid Betty writes, that I dare say her friends can hardly make it out.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> She had not the advantage of learning when young, for you know
she taught herself since she came to us, which was a very sensible thing
of her, and I suppose she will improve. Well, but accounts are almost
as necessary as writing; for how could I cast up all the market-bills and
tradesman’s accounts, and keep my housebooks, without it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> And what is the use of that, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> It is of use to prevent our being overcharged in anything, and to
know exactly how much we spend, and whether or not we are exceeding
our income, and in what articles we ought to be more saving. Without
keeping accounts the richest man might soon come to be ruined, before
he knew that his affairs were going wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span><em>K.</em> But do women always keep accounts? I thought that was
generally the business of the men.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> It is their business to keep the accounts belonging to their trade,
or profession, or estate; but it is the business of their wives to keep all
the household accounts; and a woman almost in any rank, unless,
perhaps, some of the highest of all, is to blame if she does not take upon
her this necessary office. I remember a remarkable instance of the
benefit which a young lady derived from an attention to this point. An
eminent merchant in London failed for a great sum!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> What does that mean, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> That he owed a great deal more than he could pay. His creditors,
that is, those to whom he was indebted, on examining his accounts, found
great deficiencies which they could not make out; for he had kept his
books very irregularly, and had omitted to put down many things that he
had bought and sold. They suspected, therefore, that great waste had
been made in the family expenses; and they were the more suspicious of
this, as a daughter, who was a very genteel young lady, was his housekeeper,
his wife being dead. She was told of this; upon which, when
the creditors were all met, she sent them her housebooks for their
examination. They were all written in a very fair hand, and every single
article was entered with the greatest regularity, and the sums were all
cast up with perfect exactness. The gentlemen were so highly pleased
with the proof of the young lady’s ability, that they all agreed to make
her a handsome present out of the effects; and one of the richest of them,
who was in want of a clever wife, soon after paid his addresses to her,
and married her.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> That was very lucky, for I suppose she took care of her poor father
when she was rich. But I shall have nothing of that sort to do a great
while.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> No; but young women should keep their own account of clothes
and pocket-money, and other expenses, as I intend you shall do when
you grow up.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Am I not to learn dancing, and music, and drawing, too, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Dancing you shall certainly learn pretty soon, because it is not
only an agreeable accomplishment in itself, but is useful in forming the
body to ease and elegance in all its motions. As to the other two, they
are merely ornamental accomplishments, which, though a woman of
middling station may be admired for possessing, yet she will never be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>censured for being without. The propriety of attempting to acquire them
must depend on natural genius for them, and upon leisure and other
accidental circumstances. For some they are too expensive, and many
are unable to make such progress in them as will repay the pains of
beginning. It is soon enough, however, for us to think about these things,
and at any rate they are not to come in till you have made a very good
proficiency in what is useful and necessary. But I see you have now
finished what I set you about, so you shall take a walk with me into
the marketplace, where I have two or three things to buy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>K.</em> Shall we not call at the bookseller’s, to inquire for those new books
that Miss Reader was talking about?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>M.</em> Perhaps we may. Now lay up your work neatly, and get on your
hat and tippet.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Tutor.</em>—Come, my boys, let us sit down awhile under yon shady tree.
I don’t know how your young legs feel, but mine are almost tired.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I am not tired, but I am very hot.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And I am hot and very dry, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> When you have cooled yourself, you may drink out of that clear

pocket. [<em>They go and sit down at the foot of the tree.</em>]</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span><em>Har.</em> What an amazing large tree! How wide its branches spread!
Pray what tree is it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I can tell you that. It is an oak. Don’t you see the acorns?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, it is an oak—the noblest tree this country produces; not
only grand and beautiful to the sight, but of the greatest importance from
its uses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I should like to know something about it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Very well; then instead of reading we will sit and talk about
oaks. George, who knew the oak by its acorns—should you have known
it if there had been none?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I don’t know; I believe not.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Observe, then, in the first place, that its bark is very rugged. Then
see in what manner it grows: its great arms run out almost horizontally
from its trunk, giving the whole tree a sort of round form, and making it
spread far on every side. Its branches are also subject to be crooked or
kneed. By these marks you might guess at an oak even in winter, when
quite bare of leaves. But its leaves afford a surer mark of distinction,
since they differ a good deal from those of other English trees, being
neither whole and even at the edges, nor yet cut like the teeth of a saw,
but rather deeply scolloped, and formed into several rounded divisions.
Their colour is a fine deep green. Then the fruit—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Fruit!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; all kinds of plants have what may properly be called fruit,
though we are apt to give that name only to such as are food for man.
The fruit of a plant is the seed, with what contains it. This, in the oak,
is called an acorn, which is a kind of nut, partly enclosed in a cup.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Acorn-cups are very pretty things. I have made boats of them,
and set them swimming in a basin.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> And if you were no bigger than a fairy, you might use them for
drinking cups, as those imaginary little beings are said to do.</p>

      <div class='line'>In acorn-cups filled to the brink.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Are acorns good to eat?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> No; that they are not. I have tried, and did not like them at all.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> In the early ages of man, before he cultivated the earth, but lived
upon such wild products as Nature afforded, we are told that acorns made
a considerable part of his food; and at this day they are eaten in Spain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and Greece, and in some other of the southern countries of Europe. But
they are sweeter and better flavoured than ours, and are produced by a
different species of oak. The chief use which we make of those which
grow in this country is to feed hogs. In those parts of England where
oak-woods are common, great herds of swine are kept, which are driven
into the woods in autumn, when the acorns fall, and provide for themselves
plentifully for two or three months. This, however, is a small
part of the praise of the oak. You will be surprised when I tell you that
to this tree our country owes its chief glory and security.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Ay! how can that be?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I don’t know whether in your reading you have ever met with
the story, that Athens, a famous city in Greece, consulting the oracle
how it might best defend itself against its enemies, was advised to trust
to wooden walls.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Wooden walls? that’s odd. I should think stone-walls better;
for wooden ones might be set on fire.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True: but the meaning was, that as Athens was a place of great
trade, and its people were skilled in maritime affairs, they ought to trust
to their ships. Well, this is the case with Great Britain. As it is an
island, it has no need of walls and fortifications, while it possesses
ships to keep all enemies at a distance. Now, we have the greatest and
finest navy in the world, by which we both defend ourselves, and attack
other nations, when they insult us; and this is all built of oak.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Would no other wood do to build ships?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> None nearly so well, especially for men-of-war; for it is the
stoutest and strongest wood we have; and, therefore, best fitted, both to
keep sound under water, and to bear the blows and shocks of the waves,
and the terrible strokes of cannon-balls. It is a peculiar excellence for
this last purpose, that oak is not so liable to splinter or shiver as other
woods, so that a ball can pass through it without making a large hole.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> No.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It was made at a time when England was more successful in
war than had ever before been known, and our success was properly
attributed chiefly to our fleet, the great support of which is the British oak
so I hope you will look upon oaks with due respect.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span><em>Har.</em> Yes; it shall always be my favourite tree.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Had not Pope reason, when he said, in his <em>Windsor Forest</em>,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let India boast her plants, nor envy we</div>
      <div class='line'>The weeping amber, or the balmy tree,</div>

      <div class='line'>And realms commanded which those trees adorn!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These lines refer to its use as well for merchant-ships as for men-of-war;
and, in fact, all our ships are for the most part built either of native
or foreign oak.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are the masts of ships made of oak?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No; it would be too heavy. Besides, it would not be easy to
find trunks of oak long and straight enough for that purpose. They are
made of various sorts of fir or pine, which grow very tall and taper.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is oak wood used for anything besides ship-building?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> O yes; it is one of the principal woods of the carpenter, being
employed wherever great strength and durability are required. It is used
for door and window frames, and the beams that are laid in walls to
strengthen them. Floors and staircases are sometimes made with it; and
in old houses in the country, which were built when oak was more plentiful
than at present, almost all the timber about them was oak. It is also
occasionally used for furniture, as tables, chairs, drawers, and bedsteads;
though mahogany has now much taken its place for the better sort of
goods, and the lighter and softer woods for the cheaper; for the hardness
of oak renders it difficult and expensive to work. It is still, however, the
chief material used in mill-work, in bridge and water works, for wagon
and cart bodies, for threshing-floors, for large casks and tubs, and for the
last piece of furniture a man has occasion for. What is that, do you
think, George?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I don’t know.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> A coffin.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> So it is.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But why should that be made of such strong wood?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> There can be no other reason than that weak attachment we are
apt to have for our bodies when we are done with them, which has made
men in various countries desirous of keeping them as long as possible
from decay. But I have not yet done with the uses of the oak. Were
either of you ever in a tanner’s yard?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span><em>Geo.</em> We often go by one at the end of the town; but we dare not go
in for fear of the great dog.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> But he is always chained in the daytime.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes; but he barks so loud and looks so fierce, that we were
afraid he would break his chain.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I doubt you are a couple of cowards. However, I suppose you
came near enough to observe great stacks of bark in the yard.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> O yes; there are several.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Those are oak-bark, and it is used in tanning the hides.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What does it do to them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I’ll tell you. The hide, when taken from the animal, after
being steeped in lime and water to get off the hair and grease, is put to
soak in a liquor made by steeping oak-bark in water. This liquor is
strongly astringent, or binding, and has the property of converting skin
into leather. The change which the hide thus undergoes renders it at
the same time less liable to decay, and soft and pliable when dry; for
raw skins, by drying, acquire nearly the hardness and consistence of
horn. Other things are also tanned for the purpose of preserving them,
as fishing-nets and boat-sails. This use of the bark of the oak makes it
a very valuable commodity; and you may see people in the woods carefully
stripping the oaks when cut down, and piling up the bark in heaps.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have seen such heaps of bark, but I thought they were only to
burn.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No; they are much too valuable for that. Well, but I have
another use of the oak to mention, and that is in dying.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Dying! I wonder what colour it can die?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Oak sawdust is a principal ingredient in dying fustians. By
various mixtures and management it is made to give them all the different
shades of drab and brown. Then, all the parts of the oak, like all other
astringent vegetables, produce a dark blue or black by the addition of any
preparation of iron. The bark is sometimes used in this way for dying
black. And did you never see what the boys call an oak-apple?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes; I have gathered them myself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Do you know what they are?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I thought they were the fruit of the oak.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No; I have told you that the acorns are the fruits. These are
excrescences formed by an insect.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> An insect! how can they make such a thing?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span><em>Tut.</em> It is a sort of fly, that has the power of piercing the outer skin
of the oak boughs, under which it lays its eggs. The part then swells
into a kind of ball, and the young insects, when hatched, eat their way
out. Well this ball or apple is a pretty strong astringent, and is sometimes
used in dying black. But in the warm countries there is a species
of oak which bears round excrescences of the same kind, called galls,
which become hard, and are the strongest astringents known. They are
the principal ingredients in the black dies, and common ink is made with
them, together with a substance called green vitriol, or copperas, which
contains iron.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have now told you the chief uses that I can recollect of the oak; and
these are so important, that whoever drops an acorn into the ground, and
takes proper care of it when it comes up, may be said to be a benefactor
to his country. Besides, no sight can be more beautiful and majestic
than a fine oak-wood. It is an ornament fit for the habitation of the first
nobleman in the land.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I wonder, then, that all rich gentlemen who have ground enough
do not cover it with oaks.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Many of them, especially of late years, have made great plantations
of these trees. But all soils do not suit them; and then there is
another circumstance which prevents many from being at this trouble and
expense, which is the long time an oak takes in growing, so that no
person can reasonably expect to profit by those of his own planting. An
oak of fifty years is greatly short of its full growth, and they are scarcely
arrived at perfection under a century. However, it is our duty to think
of posterity as well as ourselves; and they who receive oaks from their
ancestors, ought certainly to furnish others to their successors.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Then I think that every one who cuts down an oak should be
obliged to plant another.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Very right—but he should plant two or three for one, for fear of
accidents in their growing.</p>

<p class='c000'>I will now repeat to you some verses describing the oak in its state of
full growth, or rather of beginning to decay, with the various animals
living upon it—and then we will walk.</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Alfred.</em> How retired and quiet is everything in this little spot! The
river winds its silent waters round this retreat; and the tangled bushes of
the thicket fence it from the attack of an enemy. The bloody Danes
have not yet pierced into this wild solitude. I believe I am safe from
their pursuit. But I hope I shall find some inhabitants here, otherwise
I shall die of hunger. Ha! here is a narrow path through the wood, and
I think I see the smoke of a cottage rising between the trees. I will bend
my steps thither.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> Good even to you, good man. Are you disposed to show
hospitality to a poor traveller?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Why truly there are so many poor travellers now-a-days, that
if we entertain them all, we shall have nothing left for ourselves.
However, come along to my wife, and we will see what can be done for
you. Wife, I am very weary: I have been chopping wood all day.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> You are always ready for your supper, but it is not ready
for you, I assure you: the cakes will take an hour to bake, and the sun is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>yet high; it has not yet dipped behind the old barn. But who have you
with you, I trow?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> Good mother, I am a stranger; and entreat you to afford me
food and shelter.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> Good mother, quotha! Good wife, if you please, and
welcome. But I do not love strangers; and the land has no reason to
love them. It has never been a merry day for Old England since strangers
came into it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> I am not a stranger in England, though I am a stranger here.
I am a trueborn Englishman.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> And do you hate those wicked Danes, that eat us up, and
burn our houses, and drive away our cattle?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> I do hate them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> Heartily! he does not speak heartily, husband.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> Heartily I hate them; most heartily.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Give me thy hand, then; thou art an honest fellow.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> I was with King Alfred in the last battle he fought.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> With King Alfred? Heaven bless him!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> What is become of our good king?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> Did you love him, then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Yes, as much as a poor man may love a king; and kneeled
down and prayed for him every night, that he might conquer those Danish
wolves; but it was not to be so.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> You could not love Alfred better than I did.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> But what is become of him?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> He is thought to be dead.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Well, these are sad times; Heaven help us! Come, you
shall be welcome to share the brown loaf with us; I suppose you are
too sharp set to be nice.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> Ay, come with us; you shall be as welcome as a prince!
But hark ye, husband; though I am very willing to be charitable to this
stranger, (it would be a sin to be otherwise,) yet there is no reason he
should not do something to maintain himself: he looks strong and capable.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Why, that’s true. What can you do, friend?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> I am very willing to help you in anything you choose to set
me about. It will please me best to earn my bread before I eat it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Let me see. Can you tie up fagots neatly?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> I have not been used to it. I am afraid I should be awkward.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span><em>Gubba.</em> Can you thatch? There is a piece blown off the cowhouse.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> Alas! I cannot thatch.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> Ask him if he can weave rushes: we want some new
baskets.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> I have never learned.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Can you stack hay?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> No.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Why, here’s a fellow! and yet he hath as many pair of hands
as his neighbours. Dame, can you employ him in the house? He might
lay wood on the fire, and rub the tables.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> Let him watch these cakes, then: I must go and milk the kine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> And I’ll go and stack the wood, since supper is not ready.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> But pray, observe, friend; do not let the cakes burn; turn
them often on the hearth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> I shall observe your directions.</p>

from their warm homes, stripped, abused, insulted; and I, whom Heaven
appointed their shepherd, unable to rescue my defenceless flock from the
ravenous jaws of these devourers! Gracious Heaven! if I am not worthy
to save this land from the Danish sword, raise up some other hero to fight
with more success than I have done, and let me spend my life in this

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> Indeed, dame, I am sorry for it: but my mind was full of sad
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Come, wife, you must forgive him; perhaps he is in love. I
remember when I was in love with thee——</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span><em>Gandelin.</em> You remember!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Yes, dame, I do remember it, though it is many a long year
since; my mother was making a kettle of furmety—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> Pr’y thee, hold thy tongue, and let us eat our suppers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> How refreshing is this sweet new milk, and this wholesome
bread!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Eat heartily, friend. Where shall we lodge him, Gandelin?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> We have but one bed you know; but there is fresh straw
in the barn.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred</em> (<em>aside</em>). If I shall not lodge like a king, at least I shall lodge
like a soldier. Alas! how many of my poor soldiers are stretched on the
bare ground!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> What noise do I hear! It is the tramping of horses.
Good husband, go and see what is the matter!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> Is it possible! Am I yet a king!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ella.</em> Their famous standard, the Danish raven, is taken; their troops
are panic-struck; the English soldiers call aloud for <em>Alfred</em>. Here is a

<p class='c000'><em>Gandelin.</em> O, my poor dear husband! we shall all be hanged, that’s

<p class='c000'><em>Gubba.</em> Why, Gandelin, do you see we might have guessed he was

for nothing else.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span><em>Alfred</em> (<em>coming forward</em>). God be praised for these tidings! Hope

them on to victory! Our friends shall now lift their heads again.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ella.</em> Yes, you have many friends, who have long been obliged, like

means no harm, poor woman!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Alfred.</em> Pardon you, good people! I not only pardon you, but thank
you. You have afforded me protection in my distress; and if ever I am
seated again on the throne of England, my first care shall be to reward
your hospitality. I am now going to protect <em>you</em>. Come, my faithful
Ella, to arms! to arms! My bosom burns to face once more the haughty
Dane; and here I vow to Heaven, that I will never sheath the sword
against these robbers, till either I lose my life in this just cause, or</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ON THE PINE AND FIR TRIBE.—<span class='sc'>A Dialogue.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Tutor</em>—<em>George</em>—<em>Harry</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Tutor.</em> Let us sit down awhile on this bench, and look about us.
What a charming prospect!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harry.</em> I admire those pleasure-grounds. What beautiful clumps of
trees there are in that lawn!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>George.</em> But what a dark gloomy wood that is at the back of the house!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is a fir plantation; and those trees always look dismal in the
summer, when there are so many finer greens to compare them with.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>But the winter is their time for show, when other trees are stripped of their
verdure.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Then they are evergreens.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; most of the fir tribe are evergreens; and as they are
generally natives of cold mountainous countries, they contribute greatly to
cheer the wintry landscape.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> You were so good when we walked out last, to tell us a great
deal about oaks. I thought it one of the prettiest lessons I ever heard. I
should be glad if you would give us such another about firs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> So should I, too, I’m sure.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> With all my heart, and I am pleased that you ask me. Nothing
is so great an encouragement to a tutor as to find his pupils of their own
accord seeking after useful knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> And I think it is very useful to know such things as these.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Certainly it is. Well, then—you may know the pine or fir tribe
in general at first sight, as most of them are of a bluish-green colour, and
all have leaves consisting of a strong narrow pointed blade, which gives
them somewhat of a stiff appearance. Then all of them bear a hard
scaly fruit, of a longish or conical form.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Are they what we call fir-apples?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; that is one of the names boys give them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> We often pick them up under trees, and throw them at each other.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have sometimes brought home my pocket full to burn. They
make a fine clear flame.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well—do you know where the seeds lie in them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> No—have they any?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—at the bottom of every scale lie two winged seeds; but
when the scales open, the seeds fall out: so that you can seldom find
any in those you pick up.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Are the seeds good for anything?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> There is a kind of pine in the south of Europe called the <em>stone-pine</em>,
the kernels of which are eaten, and said to be as sweet as an almond.
And birds pick out the seeds of other sorts, though they are so well
defended by the woody scales.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> They must have good strong bills then.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Of this tribe of trees a variety of species are found in different
countries, and are cultivated in this. But the only kind native here is the
<em>wild-pine</em> or <em>Scotch-fir</em>. Of this, there are large natural forests in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Highlands of Scotland; and the principal plantations consist of it. It
is a hardy sort, fit for barren and mountainous soils, but grows slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Pray, what are those very tall trees that grow in two rows before
the old hall in our village?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are the <em>common</em> or <em>spruce fir</em>, a native of Norway, and
other northern countries, and one of the loftiest of the tribe. But observe
those trees that grow singly in the grounds opposite to us with widespread
branches spreading downward, and trailing on the ground, thence
gradually lessening till the top of the tree ends almost in a point.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What beautiful trees!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are the Pines called <em>Larches</em>, natives of the Alps and
Apennines, introduced into this country about the middle of the last
century, for the purpose, at first, of decorating our gardens, and of which
extensive plantations for timber have since been made, both in England
and Scotland. These are not properly evergreens, as they shed their
leaves in winter, but quickly recover them again. Then we have besides
the <em>Weymouth pine</em>, which is the tallest species in America—the <em>silver
fir</em>, so called from the silvery hue of its foliage—the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinaster</span></em>—and a
tree of ancient fame, the <em>cedar of Lebanon</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I suppose that is a very great tree?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It grows to a large size, but is slow in coming to its full growth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are pines and firs very useful trees?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Perhaps the most so of any. By much the greatest part of the
wood at present used among us comes from them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What—more than from the oak?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, much more. Almost all the timber used in building houses,
for floors, beams, rafters, and roofs, is fir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Does it all grow in this country?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Scarcely any of it. Norway, Sweden, and Russia, are the
countries from which we draw our timber, and a vast trade there is in it.
You have seen timber-yards?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> O yes—several.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> In them you would observe some very long thick beams, called
balks. These are whole trees, only stripped of the bark and squared.
You would also see great piles of planks and boards, of different lengths
and thickness. Those are called <em>deal</em>, and are brought over ready sawn
from the countries where they grow. They are of different colours. The
white are chiefly from the fir-tree; the yellow and red from the pine.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span><em>Har.</em> I suppose there must be great forests of them in those countries,
or else they could not send us so much.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes: the mountains of Norway are overrun with them, enough
for the supply of all Europe; but on account of their ruggedness, and
the want of roads, it is found impossible to get the trees, when felled,
down to the seacoast, unless they grow near some river.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> How do they manage then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They take the opportunity when the rivers are swelled with rains
or melted snow, and tumble the trees into them, when they are carried
down to the mouth of the rivers, where they are stopped by a kind of pens.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I should like to see them swimming down the stream.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—it would be curious enough; for in some places these
torrents roll over rocks, making steep waterfalls, down which the trees
are carried headlong, and do not rise again till they are got to a great
distance; and many of them are broken, and torn to pieces in the passage.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are these woods used for anything besides building?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> For a variety of purposes; such as boxes, trunks, packing-cases,
pales, wainscots, and the like. Deal is a very soft wood, easily worked,
light, and cheap, which makes it preferred for so many uses, though it is
not very durable, and is very liable to split.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes—I know my box is made of deal, and the lid is split all to
pieces with driving nails into it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are ships ever built with fir?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It was one of the first woods made use of for naval purposes;
and in the poets you will find the words <em>pine</em> and <em>fir</em> frequently
employed to signify <em>ship</em>. But as navigation has improved, the stronger
and more durable woods have generally taken its place. However, in
the countries where fir is very plentiful, large ships are still built with
it; for though they last but a short time, they cost so little in proportion,
that the profit of a few voyages is sufficient to repay the expense. Then,
from the great lightness of the wood, they swim higher in the water, and
consequently will bear more loading. Most of the large ships that bring
timber from Archangel, in Russia, are built of fir. As for the masts of
ships, those I have already told you are all made of fir or pine, on
account of their straightness and lightness.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are there not some lines in Milton’s <em>Paradise Lost</em> about that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes: the spear of Satan is magnified by a comparison with a
lofty pine.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>His spear, to equal which the tallest pine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast</div>
      <div class='line'>Of some great admiral, were but a wand.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I remember, too, that the walking-staff of the giant Polypheme
was a pine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Ay—so Homer and Ovid tell us, and he must have been a giant
indeed, to use such a stick. Well, so much for the wood of these trees.
But I have more to say about their uses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I am glad of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> All of the tribe contain a juice of a bitterish taste and strong
fragrant smell. This, in some, is so abundant as to flow out from
incisions; when it is called <em>turpentine</em>. The larch, in particular,
yields a large quantity. Turpentine is one of the substances called
resinous; it is sticky, transparent, very inflammable, and will not mix
<em>with</em> water, but will dissolve in spirits of wine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What is it used for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is used medicinally, particularly in the composition of
plasters and ointments. It also is an ingredient in varnishes, cements,
and the like. An oil distilled from turpentine is employed in medicine,
and is much used by painters for mixing up their colours. What remains
after getting this oil is common <em>resin</em>. All these substances take fire very
easily, and burn with a great flame; and the wood of the pine has so
much of this quality, when dry, that it is often used for torches.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I know deal shavings burn very briskly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes; and matches are made of bits of deal dipped in brimstone.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True,—and when it was the custom to burn the bodies of the
dead, as you read in Homer and other old authors, the pines and pitch-trees
composed great part of the funeral pile.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But what are pitch-trees? Does pitch grow upon trees?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I was going on to tell you about that. <em>Tar</em> is a product of the
trees of this kind, especially of one species, called the pitch-pine. The
wood is burnt in a sort of oven made in the earth, and the resinous juice
sweats out, and acquires a peculiar taste and a black colour from the fire.
This is tar. Tar when boiled down to dryness becomes <em>pitch</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Tar and pitch are chiefly used about ships; are they not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They resist moisture, and therefore are of great service in
preventing things from decaying that are exposed to wet. For this
reason, the cables and other ropes of ships are well soaked with tar; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the sides of ships are covered with pitch mixed with other ingredients.
Their seams, too, or the places where the planks join, are filled with tow
dipped in a composition of resin, tallow, and pitch, to keep out the water.
Wood for paling, for piles, for coverings of roofs and other purposes of
the like nature, is often tarred over. Cisterns and casks are pitched to
prevent leaking.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But what are sheep tarred for after they are sheared?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> To cure wounds and sores in their skin. For the like purposes
an ointment made with tar is often rubbed upon children’s heads. Several
parts of the pine are medicinal. The tops and green cones of the spruce-fir
are fermented with treacle, and the liquor, called <em>spruce-beer</em>, is much
drunk in America, particularly for the scurvy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is it pleasant?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Not to those who are unaccustomed to it. Well—I have
now finished my lesson, so let us walk.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Shall we go through the grounds?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; and then we will view some of the different kinds of fir
and pine more closely, and I will show you the difference of their leaves
and cones, by which they are distinguished.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ON DIFFERENT STATIONS IN LIFE.—<span class='sc'>A Dialogue.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Little Sally Meanwell had one day been to pay an afternoon’s visit to
Miss Harriet, the daughter of Sir Thomas Pemberton. The evening
proving rainy, she was sent home in Sir Thomas’s coach; and on her
return, the following conversation passed between her and her mother:—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. Meanwell.</em> Well, my dear, I hope you have had a pleasant visit?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> O yes, mamma, very pleasant; you cannot think how many
fine things I have seen. And then it is so charming to ride in a coach!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> I suppose Miss Harriet showed you all her playthings?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> O yes, such fine large dolls, so smartly dressed as I never saw
in my life before. Then she has a baby-house, and all sorts of furniture
in it; and a grotto all made of shells, and shining stones. And then she
showed me all her fine clothes for the next ball; there’s a white slip all
full of spangles, and pink ribands; you can’t think how beautiful it looks!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> And what did you admire most of all these fine things?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> I don’t know—I admired them all; and I think I liked riding
in the coach better than all the rest. Why don’t we keep a coach;
and why have I not such fine clothes and playthings as Miss Harriet?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span><em>Mrs. M.</em> Because we cannot afford it, my dear. Your papa is not so
rich by a great deal, as Sir Thomas; and if we were to lay out our money
upon such things, we should not be able to procure food and raiment and
other necessaries for you all.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> But why is not papa as rich as Sir Thomas?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Sir Thomas had a large estate left him by his father; but
your papa has little but what he gains by his own industry.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> But why should not papa be as rich as anybody else? I am
sure he deserves it as well.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Do you not think that there are a great many people poorer
than he, that are also very deserving?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> Are there?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Yes, to be sure. Don’t you know what a number of poor
people there are all around us, who have few of the comforts we enjoy?
What do you think of Ploughman the labourer? I believe you never saw
him idle in your life.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> No; he is gone to work long before I am up, and he does not
return till almost bedtime, unless it be for his dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Well! how do you think his wife and children live? should
you like that we should change places with them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> O, no! they are so dirty and ragged.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> They are, indeed, poor creatures; but I am afraid they
suffer worse evils than that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> What mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Why I am afraid they often do not get as much victuals as
they could eat. And then in winter they must be half frozen for want of
fire and warm clothing. How do you think you could bear all this?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> Indeed, I don’t know. But I have seen Ploughman’s wife carry
great brown loaves into the house; and I remember once eating some
brown bread and milk, and I thought it very good.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> I believe you would not much like it constantly; besides,
they can hardly get enough of that. But you seem to know almost as
little of the poor as the young French princess did.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> What was that, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Why, there had been one year so bad a harvest in France
that numbers of the poor were famished to death. This calamity was so
much talked of, that it reached the court, and was mentioned before the
young princesses. “Dear me!” said one of them, “how <em>silly</em> that was!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Why, rather than be famished, I would eat bread and cheese.” Her
governess was then obliged to acquaint her that the greatest part of her
father’s subjects scarcely ever eat anything better than black bread all
their lives; and that vast numbers would now think themselves very
happy to get only half their usual pittance of that. Such wretchedness
as this was what the princess had not the least idea of; and the account
shocked her so much, that she was glad to sacrifice all her finery to
afford some relief to the sufferings of the poor.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> But I hope there is nobody famished in our country.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> I hope not, for we have laws by which every person is
entitled to relief from the parish, if he is unable to gain a subsistence;
and were there no laws about it, I am sure it would be our duty to part
with every superfluity, rather than let a fellow-creature perish for want
of necessaries.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> Then do you think it was wrong for Miss Pemberton to have
all those fine things?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> No, my dear, if they are suitable to her fortune, and do not
consume the money which ought to be employed in more useful things
to herself and others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> But why might she not be contented with such things as I
have; and give the money that the rest cost to the poor?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Because she can afford both to be charitable to the poor, and
also to indulge herself in these pleasures. But do you recollect that the
children of Mr. White the baker, and Mr. Shape the tailor, might just
ask the same questions about you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> How so?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Are not you as much better dressed, and as much more plentifully
supplied with playthings than they are, as Miss Harriet is than you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> Why, I believe I may, for I remember Polly White was very
glad of one of my old dolls; and Nancy Shape cried for such a sash as
mine, but her mother would not let her have one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Then you see, my dear, that there are many who have fewer
things to be thankful for than <em>you</em> have; and you may also learn what
ought to be the true measure of the expectations of children, and the
indulgences of parents.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> I don’t quite understand you, mamma.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Everything ought to be suited to the station in which we
live or are likely to live, and the wants and duties of it. Your papa and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>I do not grudge laying out part of our money to promote the innocent
pleasure of our children: but it would be very wrong in us to lay out so
much on this account as would oblige us to spare in more necessary
articles; as in their education, and the common household expenses
required in our way of living. Besides, it would be so far from making
you happier, that it would be doing you the greatest injury.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> How could that be, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> If you were now to be dressed like Miss Pemberton, don’t
you think you would be greatly mortified at being worse dressed when
you came to be a young woman?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> I believe I should, mamma; for then perhaps I might go to
assemblies; and to be sure I should like to be as smart then as at any time.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Well, but it would be still more improper for us to dress you
then beyond our circumstances, because your necessary clothes will then
cost more, you know. Then, if we were now to hire a coach or chair for you
to go visiting in, should you like to leave it off ever afterward? But
you have no reason to expect that you will be able to have those indulgences
when you are a woman. And so it is in everything else. The
more fine things, and the more gratifications you have now, the more you
will require hereafter: for custom makes things so familiar to us, that
while we enjoy them less we want them more.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> How is that, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Why, don’t you think you have enjoyed your ride in the
coach this evening more than Miss Harriet should have done?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> I suppose I have; because if Miss Harriet liked it so well, she
would be always riding, for I know she might have the coach whenever
she pleased.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> But if you were both told that you were never to ride in a
coach again, which would think it the greater hardship? You could
walk, you know, as you have always done before; but she would rather
stay at home, I believe, than expose herself to the cold wind, and trudge
through the wet and dirt in pattens.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sally.</em> I believe so, too; and now, mamma, I see that all you have told
me is very right.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. M.</em> Well, my dear, let it dwell upon your mind, so as to make
you cheerful and contented in your station, which you see is so much
happier than that of many and many other children. So now we will talk
no more on the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Stangrove.</em> It is. Do you hear what a cawing the birds make?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> Yes; and I see them hopping about among the boughs. Pray, are
not rooks the same with crows?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span><em>Mr. St.</em> They are a species of crow; but they differ from the carrion
crow and raven in not living upon dead flesh, but upon corn and other
seeds, and grass. They indeed pick up beetles and other insects and
worms. See what a number of them have lighted on yonder ploughed
field, almost blackening it over.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> What are they doing?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> Searching for grubs and worms. You see the men in the
field do not molest them, for they do a great deal of service by destroying
grubs, which, if they were suffered to grow to winged insects, would
do much mischief to the trees and plants.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> But do they hurt the corn?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> Yes, they tear up a good deal of green corn, if they are not
driven away. But upon the whole, rooks are reckoned the farmers’ friends;
and they do not choose to have them destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> Do all rooks live in rookeries?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> It is the general nature of them to associate together, and
build in numbers on the same or adjoining trees. But this is often in the
midst of woods or natural groves. However, they have no objections to
the neighbourhood of man, but readily take to a plantation of tall trees,
though it be close to a house; and this is commonly called a rookery.
They will even fix their habitations on trees in the midst of towns; and
I have seen a rookery in a churchyard in one of the closest parts of London.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> I think a rookery is a sort of town itself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> It is: a village in the air, peopled with numerous inhabitants;
and nothing can be more amusing than to view them all in motion, flying
to and fro, and busied in their several occupations. The spring is their
busiest time. Early in the year they begin to repair their nests or build
new ones.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> Do they all work together or every one for itself?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> Each pair, after they have coupled, build their own nest; and
instead of helping, they are very apt to steal the materials from one
another. If both birds go out at once in search of sticks, they often find
at their return, the work all destroyed, and the materials carried off; so
that one of them generally stays at home to keep watch. However, I
have met with a story which shows that they are not without some sense
of the criminality of thieving. There was in a rookery a lazy pair of
rooks, who never went out to get sticks for themselves, but made a practice
of watching when their neighbours were abroad, and helped themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>from their nests. They had served most of the community in this manner
and by these means had just finished their own nest; when all the other
rooks in a rage, fell upon them at once, pulled their nest in pieces, beat
them soundly, and drove them from their society.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> That was very right—I should have liked to have seen it. But
why do they live together if they do not help one another?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> They probably receive pleasure from the company of their
own kind, as men and various other creatures do. Then, though they
do not assist one another in building, they are mutually serviceable in
many ways. If a large bird of prey hovers about a rookery for the
purpose of carrying off any of the young ones, they all unite to drive him
away. When they are feeding in a flock, several are placed as sentinels
upon the trees all round, who give the alarm if any danger approaches.
They often go a long way from home to feed; but every evening the
whole flock returns, making a loud cawing as they fly, as if to direct and
call in the stragglers. The older rooks take the lead: you may distinguish
them by the whiteness of their bills, occasioned by their frequent digging
in the ground, by which the black feathers at the root of the bill are worn off.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> Do rooks always keep to the same trees?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> Yes; they are much attached to them, and when the trees
happen to be cut down, they seem greatly distressed, and keep hovering
about them as they are falling, and will scarcely desert them when they
lie on the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> Poor things! I suppose they feel as we should if our town was
burnt down or overthrown by an earthquake.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> No doubt. The societies of animals greatly resemble those of
men; and that of rooks is like those of men in a savage state, such as the
communities of the North American Indians. It is a sort of league for
mutual aid and defence, but in which every one is left to do as he pleases,
without any obligation to employ himself for the whole body. Others
unite in a manner resembling more civilized societies of men. This
is the case with the beavers. They perform great public works by
the united efforts of the whole community, such as damming up streams,
and constructing mounds for their habitations. As these are works of
great art and labour, some of them must probably act under the direction
of others, and be compelled to work whether they will or not. Many
curious stories are told to this purpose by those who have observed them
in their remotest haunts, where they exercise their full sagacity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span><em>Fr.</em> But are they all true?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> That is more than I can answer for; yet what we certainly
know of the economy of bees may justify us in believing extraordinary
things of the sagacity of animals. The society of bees goes farther than
that of beavers, and, in some respects, beyond most among men themselves.
They not only inhabit a common dwelling, and perform great works in
common, but they lay up a store of provision, which is the property of the
whole community, and is not used except at certain seasons, and under
certain regulations. A beehive is a true image of a commonwealth,
where no member acts for himself alone, but for the whole body.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> But there are drones among them who do not work at all.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> Yes; and at the approach of winter they are driven out of the
hive, and left to perish with cold and hunger. But I have not leisure at
present to tell you more about bees. You shall one day see them at
work in a glass hive. In the meantime, remember one thing, which
applies to all the societies of animals; and I wish it did as well to all
those of men likewise.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> What is that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. St.</em> The principle upon which they all associate, is to obtain some
benefit for the <em>whole body</em>, not to give particular advantages to a few.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE SHIP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Charles Osborn, when at home in the holydays, had a visit from a
schoolfellow who was just entered as a midshipman on board of a man-of-war.
<em>Tom Hardy</em> (that was his name) was a free-hearted, spirited
lad, and a favourite among his companions; but he never liked his book,
and had left school ignorant of almost everything he came there to learn.
What was worse, he had got a contempt for learning of all kinds, and
was fond of showing it. “What does your father mean,” says he, to
Charles, “to keep you moping and studying over things of no use in the
world but to plague folks?—Why can’t you go into his majesty’s service
like me, and be made a gentleman of? You are old enough, and I know
you are a lad of spirit.” This kind of talk made some impression upon
young <em>Osborn</em>. He became less attentive to the lessons his father set
him, and less willing to enter into instructive conversation. This change
gave his father much concern; but as he knew the cause, he thought it
best, instead of employing direct authority, to attempt to give a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>impression to his son’s mind, which might counteract the effect of his
companion’s suggestions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being acquainted with an East India captain, who was on the point of
sailing, he went with his son to pay him a farewell visit on board his ship.
They were shown all about the vessel, and viewed all the preparations
for so long a voyage. They saw her weigh anchor and unfurl her sails;
and they took leave of their friend amid the shouts of the seamen and all
the bustle of departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles was highly delighted with this scene, and as they were returning
could think and talk of nothing else. It was easy, therefore, for his father
to lead him into the following train of discourse:—</p>

<p class='c000'>After Charles had been warmly expressing his admiration of the grand
sight of a large ship completely fitted out and getting under sail, “I do
not wonder,” said his father, “that you are so much struck with it; it is,
in reality, one of the finest spectacles created by human skill, and the
noblest triumph of art over untaught nature. Near two thousand years
ago, when Julius Cesar came over to this island, he found the natives in
possession of no other kind of vessel than a sort of canoe, formed of
wickerwork covered with hides, no bigger than a man or two could carry.
But the largest ship in Cesar’s fleet was not more superior to these, than
the Indiaman you have been seeing is to what that was. Our savage
ancestors ventured only to paddle along the rivers and coasts, or cross
small arms of the sea in calm weather; and Cesar himself would have
been alarmed to be a few days out of sight of land. But the ship we have
just left is going by itself to the opposite side of the globe, prepared to
encounter the tempestuous winds and mountainous waves of the vast
Southern ocean, and to find its way to its destined port, though many
weeks must pass with nothing in view but sea and sky. Now what do
you think can be the cause of this prodigious difference in the powers of
man at one period and another?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Is it not that there is a great deal more knowledge in one than in
the other?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> To be sure it is.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Would it not, think you, be as impossible for any number of men
untaught, by their utmost efforts, to build and navigate such a ship as we
have seen, as to fly through the air?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I suppose it would.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span><em>Fa.</em> That we may be the more sensible of this, let us consider how
many arts and professions are necessary for this purpose. Come—you
shall begin to name them, and if you forget any, I will put you in mind.
What is the first?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> The ship-carpenter, I think.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> True—what does he do?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> He builds the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> How is that done?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> By fastening the planks and beams together.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> But do you suppose he can do this as a common carpenter makes
a box or set of shelves?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I do not know.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Do you not think that such a vast bulk requires a good deal of
contrivance to bring it into shape, and fit it for all its purposes?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Some ships, you have heard, sail quicker than others—some bear
storms better—some carry more lading—some draw less water—and so
on. You do not suppose all these things are left to chance?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> In order to produce these effects with certainty, it is necessary to
study proportions very exactly, and to lay down an accurate scale by
mathematical lines and figures after which to build the ship. Much has
been written upon this subject, and nice calculations have been made of
the resistance a ship meets with in making way through the water, and
the best means of overcoming it; also of the action of the wind on the
sails, and their action in pushing on the ship by means of the masts. All
these must be understood by a perfect master of ship-building.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But I think I know ship-builders who have never had an education
to fit them for understanding these things.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Very likely; but they have followed by rote the rules laid down
by others; and as they work merely by imitation, they cannot alter or
improve as occasion may require. Then, though common merchant-ships
are trusted to such builders, yet, in constructing men-of-war and
Indiamen persons of science are always employed. The French, however,
attend to this matter more than we do, and, in consequence, their
ships generally sail better than ours.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But need a captain of a ship know all these things?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It may not be absolutely necessary; yet occasions may frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>arise in which it would be of great advantage for him to be able to judge
and give direction in these matters. But suppose the ship built—what
comes next?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I think she must be rigged.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Well—who are employed for this purpose?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Mast-makers, ropemakers, sailmakers, and I know not how many
other people.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> These are all mechanical trades; and though in carrying them on
much ingenuity has been applied in the invention of machines and tools,
yet we will not stop to consider them. Suppose her, then, rigged—what
next?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> She must take in her guns and powder.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Stop there and reflect how many arts you have now set to work.
Gunpowder is one of the greatest inventions of modern times, and what
has given such a superiority to civilized nations over the barbarous? An
English frigate, surrounded by the canoes of all the savages in the world,
would easily beat them off by means of her guns; and if Cesar were to
come again to England with his fleet, a battery of cannon would sink all
his ships, and set his legions a swimming in the sea. But the making of
gunpowder, and the casting of cannon, are arts that require an exact
knowledge of the science of <em>Chymistry</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> What is that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It comprehends the knowledge of all the properties of metals and
minerals, salts, sulphur, oils, and gums, and of the action of fire, and water,
and air upon all substances, and the effects of mixing different things
together. Gunpowder is a mixture of three things only; saltpetre or nitre,
sulphur or brimstone, and charcoal. But who could have thought such a
wonderful effect would have been produced by it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Was it not first discovered by accident?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yes; but it was by one who was making chymical experiments,
and many more experiments have been employed to bring it to perfection.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But need a captain know how to make gunpowder and cannon?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It is not necessary, though it may often be useful to him. However,
it is quite necessary that he should know how to employ them. Now
the sciences of gunnery and fortification depend entirely upon mathematical
principles; for by these are calculated the direction of a ball through
the air, the distance it would reach to, and the force with which it will
strike any thing. All engineers, therefore, must be good mathematicians.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span><em>Ch.</em> But I think have heard of gunners being little better than common
men.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> True—there is a way of doing that business, as well as many
others, by mere practice: and an uneducated man may acquire skill in
pointing a cannon, as well as in shooting with a common gun. But this
is only in ordinary cases, and an abler head is required to direct. Well—now
suppose your ship completely fitted out for sea, and the wind blowing
fair; how will you navigate her?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I would spread the sails, and steer by the rudder.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Very well—but how would you find your way to the port you are
bound for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> That I cannot tell.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Nor, perhaps, can I make you exactly comprehend it; but I can
show you enough to convince you that it is an affair that requires much
knowledge and early study. In former times, when a vessel left the sight
of land, it was steered by observation of the sun by day, and the moon
and stars by night. The sun, you know, rises in the east, and sets in the
west; and at noon, in these parts of the world, it is exactly south of us.
These points, therefore, may be found out when the sun shines. The
moon and stars vary: however, their place in the sky may be known by
exact observation. Then, there is one star that always points to the north
pole, and is therefore called the pole-star. This was of great use in navigation,
and the word pole-star is often used by the poets to signify a sure
guide. Do you recollect the description in Homer’s Odyssey, when Ulysses
sails away by himself from the island of Calypso—how he steers by
the stars?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I think I remember the lines in Pope’s translation.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Repeat them, then.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em></p>
<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Placed at the helm he sat, and mark’d the skies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor closed in sleep his ever-watchful eyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>There view’d the Pleiades, and the Northern Team,</div>
      <div class='line'>And great Orion’s more effulgent beam,</div>
      <div class='line'>To which, around the axle of the sky,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Bear revolving points his golden eye:</div>
      <div class='line'>Who shines exalted on th’ ethereal plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Very well; they are fine lines, indeed! You see, then, how long
ago sailors thought it necessary to study astronomy. But as it frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>happens, especially in stormy weather, that the stars are not to be seen,
this method was subject to great uncertainty, which rendered it dangerous
to undertake distant voyages. At length, near 500 years since, a property
was discovered in a mineral, called the magnet or loadstone, which
removed the difficulty. This was, its <em>polarity</em>, or quality of always
pointing to the poles of the earth, that is, due north and south. This it
can communicate to any piece of iron; so that a needle well rubbed in a
particular manner by a loadstone, and then balanced upon its centre so as
to turn round freely, will always point to the north. With an instrument
called a mariner’s compass, made of one of these needles, and a card
marked with all the points—north, south, east, west, and the divisions
between these, a ship may be steered to any part of the globe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> It is a very easy matter, then.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Not quite so easy, neither. In a long voyage, cross or contrary
winds blow a ship out of her direct course, so that without nice calculations
both of the straight track she has gone, and all the deviations from
it, the sailors would not know where they were, nor to what point to
steer. It is also frequently necessary to take observations, as they call
it; that is, to observe with an instrument where the sun’s place in the
sky is at noon, by which they can determine the <em>latitude</em> they are in.
Other observations are necessary to determine their <em>longitude</em>. What
these mean, I can show you upon the globe. It is enough now to say
that, by means of both together, they can tell the exact spot they are on
at any time; and then, by consulting their map, and setting their compass,
they can steer right to the place they want. But all this requires a very
exact knowledge of astronomy, the use of the globes, mathematics, and
arithmetic, which you may suppose is not to be acquired without much
study. A great number of curious instruments have been invented to
assist in these operations; so that there is scarcely any matter in which
so much art and science have been employed as in navigation; and none
but a very learned and civilized nation can excel in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But how is Tom Hardy to do? for I am pretty sure he does not
understand any of these things.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> He must learn them, if he means to come to anything in his
profession. He may, indeed, head a pressgang, or command a boat’s
crew without them; but he will never be fit to take charge of a man-of-war,
or even a merchant-ship.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> However, he need not learn Latin and Greek.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span><em>Fa.</em> I cannot say, indeed, that a sailor has occasion for those languages;
but a knowledge of Latin makes it much easier to acquire all modern
languages; and I hope you do not think them unnecessary to him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I did not know they were of much importance.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No! Do you think that one who may probably visit most countries
in Europe, and their foreign settlements, should be able to converse in no
other language than his own? If the knowledge of languages is not useful
to <em>him</em>, I know not to whom it is so. He can hardly do at all without
knowing some; and the more the better.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Poor Tom! then I doubt he has not chosen so well as he thinks.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> I doubt so, too.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here ended the conversation. They soon after reached home, and
Charles did not forget to desire his father to show him on the globe what
longitude and latitude meant.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THINGS BY THEIR RIGHT NAMES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Charles.</em> Papa, you grow very lazy. Last winter you used to tell us
stories, and now you never tell us any; and we are all got round the fire
quite ready to hear you. Pray, dear papa, let us have a very pretty one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Father.</em> With all my heart—What shall it be?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> A bloody murder, papa!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> A bloody murder! Well then—once upon a time some men
dressed all alike....</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> With black crapes over their faces?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No; they had steel caps on.—having crossed a dark heath, wound
cautiously along the skirts of a deep forest....</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> They were ill-looking fellows, I dare say?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> I cannot say so; on the contrary, they were as tall, personable
men as most one shall see: leaving on their right hand an old ruined
tower on the hill....</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> At midnight, just as the clock struck twelve; was it not, papa?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No, really; it was on a fine balmy summer’s morning;—they
moved forward, one behind another....</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> As still as death, creeping along under the hedges?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> On the contrary—they walked remarkably upright; and so far
from endeavouring to be hushed and still, they made a loud noise as they
came along, with several sorts of instruments.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span><em>Ch.</em> But, papa, they would be found out immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> They did not seem to wish to conceal themselves: on the contrary,
they gloried in what they were about. They moved forward, I say, to a
large plain, where stood a neat pretty village which they set on fire.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Set a village on fire, wicked wretches!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And while it was burning they murdered—twenty thousand men.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> O fie! papa! You don’t intend I should believe this; I thought
all along you were making up a tale, as you often do; but you shall not
catch me this time. What! they lay still, I suppose, and let these
fellows cut their throats?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No, truly, they resisted as long as they could.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> How should these men kill twenty thousand people, pray?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Why not? the <em>murderers</em> were thirty thousand.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> O, now I have found you out! you mean a <span class='fss'>BATTLE</span>.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF INDUR.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>At the time when fairies and genii possessed the powers which they
have now lost, there lived in the country of the Bramins, a man named
Indur, who was distinguished, not only for that gentleness of disposition
and humanity towards all living creatures, which are so much cultivated
among those people, but for an insatiable curiosity respecting the nature
and way of life of all animals. In pursuit of knowledge of this kind he
would frequently spend the night among lonely rocks, or in the midst
of thick forests; and there under shelter of a hanging cliff, or mounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>upon a high tree, he would watch the motions and actions of all the
animals that seek their prey in the night; and remaining in the same spot
till the break of day, he would observe this tribe of creatures retiring to
their dens, and all others coming forth to enjoy the beams of the rising
sun. On these occasions, if he saw any opportunity of exercising his
benevolence toward animals in distress, he never failed to make use of
it; and many times rescued the small bird from the pitiless hawk, and
the lamb or kid from the gripe of the wolf and lynx. One day as he was
sitting on a tree in the forest, a little frolicsome monkey, in taking a
great leap from one bough to another, chanced to miss its hold, and fell
from a great height to the ground. As it lay there unable to move, Indur
espied a large venomous serpent advancing to make the poor defenceless
creature his prey. He immediately descended from his post, and taking
the little monkey in his arms, ran with it to the tree, and gently placed it
upon a bough. In the meantime, the enraged serpent pursuing him,
overtook him before he could mount the tree, and bit him in the leg.
Presently, the limb began to swell, and the effects of the venom became
visible over Indur’s whole frame. He grew faint, sick, and pale; and
sinking on the ground was sensible that his last moments were fast
approaching. As thus he lay, he was surprised to hear a human voice
from the tree; and looking up, he beheld, on the bow where he had
placed the monkey, a beautiful woman, who thus addressed him:—“Indur,
I am truly grieved that thy kindness to me should have been the cause of
thy destruction. Know that, in the form of the poor monkey, it was the
potent fairy Perizinda to whom thou gavest succour. Obliged to pass a
certain number of days every year under the shape of an animal, I have
chosen this form; and though not mortal, I should have suffered extreme
agonies from the bite of the serpent, hadst thou not so humanely assisted
me. It is not in my power to prevent the fatal effect of the poison; but I
am able to grant thee any wish thou shalt form respecting the future state
of existence to which thou art now hastening. Speak then, before it be
too late, and let me show my gratitude.”—“Great Perizinda!” replied
Indur, “since you deign so bounteously to return my service, this is the
request that I make; in all my transmigrations may I retain a rational
soul, with the memory of the adventures I have gone through; and when
death sets me free from one body, may I instantly animate another in the
prime of its powers and faculties, without passing through the helpless
state of infancy.”—“It is granted,” answered the fairy; and immediately,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>breaking a small branch from the tree, and breathing on it, she threw it
down to Indur, and bid him hold it fast in his hand. He did so, and
presently expired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly, he found himself in a green valley, by the side of a clear
stream, grazing amid a herd of antelopes. He admired his elegant shape,
sleek, spotted skin, and polished spiral horns; and drank with delight of
the cool rivulet, cropped the juicy herb, and sported with his companions.
Soon an alarm was given of the approach of an enemy; and they all set
off with the swiftness of the wind, to the neighbouring immense plains,
where they were presently out of the reach of injury. Indur was highly
delighted with the ease and rapidity of his motions; and snuffing the keen
air of the desert, bounded away, scarcely deigning to touch the ground
with his feet. This way of life went on very pleasantly for some time,
till at length the herd was one morning alarmed with noises of trumpets,
drums, and loud shouts on every side. They started, and ran first to the
right, then to the left, but were continually driven back by the surrounding
crowd, which now appeared to be a whole army of hunters, with the king
of the country, and all his nobles, assembled at a solemn chase, after the
manner of the Eastern people. And now the circle began to close, and
numbers of affrighted animals of various kinds thronged together in the
centre, keeping as far as possible from the dangers that approached them
from all quarters. The huntsmen were now come near enough to reach
their game with their arrows; and the prince and his lords shot at them
as they passed and repassed, killing and wounding great numbers. Indur
and his surviving companions, seeing no other means of escape, resolved
to make a bold push toward that part of the ring which was the most
weakly guarded; and though many perished in the attempt, yet a few,
leaping over the heads of the people, got clear away: Indur was among
the number. But while he was scouring over the plain, rejoicing in his
good fortune and conduct, an enemy swifter than himself overtook him.
This was a falcon, who, let loose by one of the huntsmen, dashed like
lightning after the fugitives; and alighting upon the head of Indur, began
to tear his eyes with his beak, and flap his wings over his face. Indur,
terrified and blinded, knew not which way he went; and instead of
proceeding straight-forward, turned round and came again toward the
hunters. One of these, riding full speed with a javelin in his hand,
came up to him, and ran the weapon into his side. He fell down, and
with repeated wounds was soon despatched.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>When the struggle of death was over, Indur was equally surprised and
pleased on finding himself soaring high in the air, as one of a flight of
wild geese, in their annual migration to breed in the arctic regions.
With vast delight he sprung forward on easy wing through the immense
fields of air, and surveyed beneath him extensive tracts of earth perpetually
varying with plains, mountains, rivers, lakes, and woods. At the
approach of night the flock lighted on the ground, and fed on the green
corn or grass; and at daybreak they were again on the wing, arranged in
regular wedge-like body, with an experienced leader at their head. Thus
for many days they continued their journey, passing over countries inhabited
by various nations, till at length they arrived in the remotest part of
Lapland, and settled in a wide marshy lake, filled with numerous reedy
islands, and surrounded on all sides with dark forests of pine and birch.
Here, in perfect security from man and hurtful animals, they followed
the great business of breeding and providing for their young, living
plentifully upon the insects and aquatic reptiles that abounded in this
sheltered spot. Indur with great pleasure exercised his various powers of
swimming, diving, and flying; sailing round the islands, penetrating into
every creek and bay, and visiting the deepest recesses of the woods. He
surveyed with astonishment the sun, instead of rising and setting, making
a complete circle in the heavens, and cheering the earth with a perpetual
day. Here he met with innumerable tribes of kindred birds varying in
size, plumage, and voice, but all passing their time in a similar manner,
and furnished with the same powers for providing food and a safe retreat
for themselves and their young. The whole lake was covered with
parties fishing or sporting, and resounded with their loud cries; while the
islands were filled with their nests, and new broods of young were continually
coming forth and launching upon the surface of the waters. One
day, Indur’s curiosity having led him at a distance from his companions
to the woody border of the lake, he was near paying dear for his heedlessness;
for a fox, that lay in wait among the bushes, sprung upon him,
and it was with the utmost difficulty that by a strong exertion he broke
from his hold, not without the loss of some feathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Summer now drawing to an end, the vast congregation of water-fowl
begun to break up; and large bodies of them daily took their way southward,
to pass the winter in climates where the waters are never so
frozen as to become uninhabitable by the feathered race. The wild geese,
to whom Indur belonged, proceeded with their young ones, by long daily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>journeys across Sweden, the Baltic sea, Poland and Turkey, to Lesser
Asia, and finished their journey at the celebrated plains on the banks of
the Cayster, a noted resort for their species ever since the age of Homer,
who in some very beautiful verses has described the manners and actions
of the various tribes of aquatic birds in that favourite spot.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Here they
soon recruited from the fatigue of their march, and enjoyed themselves in
the delicious climate till winter. This season, though here extremely
mild, yet making the means of sustenance somewhat scarce, they were
obliged to make foraging excursions to the cultivated lands in the neighbourhood.
Having committed great depredations upon a fine field of young
wheat, the owner spread a net on the ground, in which Indur, with several
of his companions, had the misfortune to be caught. No mercy was shown
them, but as they were taken out one by one, their necks were all broken.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indur was not immediately sensible of the next change he underwent,
which was into a dormouse, fast asleep into a hole at the foot of a bush.
As it was in a country where the winter was pretty severe, he did not
awake for some weeks; when a thaw having taken place, and the sun
beginning to warm the earth, he unrolled himself one day, stretched,
opened his eyes, and not being able to make out where he was, he roused
a female companion whom he found by his side. When she was
sufficiently awakened, and they both began to feel hungry, she led the
way to a magazine of nuts and acorns, where they made a comfortable
meal, and soon fell asleep again. This nap having lasted a few days,
they awaked a second time, and having eaten, they ventured to crawl to
the mouth of their hole, where, pulling away some withered grass and
leaves, they peeped out into the open air. After taking a turn or two
in the sun, they grew chill, and went down again, stopping up the
entrance after them. The cold weather returning, they took another
long nap, till, at length, spring being fairly set in, they roused in earnest,
and began to make daily excursions abroad. Their winter-stock of
provisions being now exhausted, they were for some time reduced to
great straits, and obliged to dig for roots and pig-nuts. Their fare was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>mended as the season advanced, and they made a nest near the bottom
of a tree, where they brought up a young family. They never ranged
far from home, nor ascended the higher branches of the tree, and passed
great part of their time in sleep, even during the midst of summer. When
autumn came, they were busily employed in collecting the nuts, acorns,
and other dry fruits that fell from the trees, and laying them up in their
storehouses underground. One day, as Indur was thus closely engaged at
some distance from his dwelling, he was seized by a wildcat, who, after
tormenting him for a time, gave him a gripe, and put him out of his pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>From one of the smallest and most defenceless of animals, Indur found
himself instantly changed into a majestic elephant, in a lofty forest in
the isle of Ceylon. Elated with this wonderful advancement in the scale
of creation, he stalked along with conscious dignity, and surveyed with
pleasing wonder his own form and that of his companions, together with
the rich scenery of the ever-verdant woods, which perfumed the air with
their spicy odour, and lifted their tall heads to the clouds. Here, fearing
no injury, and not desirous to do any, the gigantic herd roamed at large,
feeding on the green branches which they tore down with their trunks,
and bathing in deep rivers during the heat of the day; and, reposing in
the depths of the forests, reclined against the massy trunks of trees by
night. It was long before Indur met with any adventure that could lead
him to doubt his security. But, one day, having penetrated into a close
entangled thicket, he espied, lurking under the thick covert, a grim tiger,
whose eyes flashed rage and fury. Though the tiger was one of the
largest of his species, yet his bulk was trifling compared with that of an
elephant, a single foot of which seemed sufficient to crush him; yet the
fierceness and cruelty of his looks, his angry growl, and grinning teeth,
struck some terror into Indur. There was little time, however, for
reflection: for when Indur had advanced a single step, the tiger, setting
up a roar, sprung to meet him, attempting to seize his lifted trunk. Indur
was dexterous enough to receive him upon one of his tusks, and exerting
all his strength, threw the tiger to a great distance. He was somewhat
stunned by the fall, but recovering, renewed the assault with redoubled
fury. Indur again, and a third time, threw him off; after which the
tiger, turning about, bounded away into the midst of the thicket. Indur
drew back, and rejoined his companions, with some abatement in the
confidence he had placed in his size and strength, which had not
prevented him from undergoing so dangerous an attack.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Soon after, he joined the rest of the herd, in an expedition beyond the
bounds of the forest, to make depredations on some fields of maize. They
committed great havoc, devouring part, but tearing up and trampling
down much more; when the inhabitants taking the alarm, assembled in
great numbers, and with fierce shouts and flaming brands drove them
back to the woods. Not contented with this, they were resolved to make
them pay for the mischief they had done, by taking some prisoners. For
this purpose they enclosed a large space among the trees with strong
posts and stakes, bringing it to a narrower and narrower compass, and
ending at last in a passage only capable of admitting one elephant at a
time. This was divided into several apartments, by strong cross-bars,
which would lift up and down. They then sent out some tame female
elephants bred to the business, who approaching the herd of wild ones,
inveigled the males to follow them toward the enclosures. Indur was
among the first who was decoyed by their artifices; and with some others
following heedlessly, he got into the narrowest part of the enclosure,
opposite to the passage. Here they stood awhile, doubting whether they
should go farther. But the females leading the way, and uttering their
cry of invitation, they ventured at length to follow. When a sufficient
number was in the passage, the bars were let down by men placed
for that purpose, and the elephants were fairly caught in a trap. As soon
as they were sensible of their situation, they fell into a fit of rage, and
with all their efforts endeavoured to break through. But the hunters
throwing nooses over them, bound them fast with strong ropes and chains
to the post on each side, and thus kept them without food or sleep for three
days; when being exhausted with hunger and fatigue, they gave signs of
sufficient tameness. They were now let out one by one, and bound each
of them to two large tame elephants with riders on their backs, and thus
without resistance were led away close prisoners. They were then put
into separate stables, and by proper discipline, were presently rendered
quite tame and gentle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not long after, Indur, with five more, was sent over from Ceylon to the
continent of India, and sold to one of the princes of the country. He was
now trained to all the services elephants are there employed in; which
were, to carry people on his back in a kind of sedan, or litter, to draw
cannon, ships, and other great weights, to kneel and rise at command,
make obeisance to his lord, and perform all the motions and attitudes he
was ordered. Thus he lived a long time well fed and caressed, clothed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>in costly trappings on days of ceremony, and contributing to the pomp of
Eastern royalty. At length, a war broke out, and Indur came to be
employed in a different scene. After proper training he was marched
with a number of his fellows, into the field, bearing on his back a small
wooden tower, in which were placed some soldiers with a small field-piece.
They soon came in sight of the enemy, and both sides were
drawn up for battle. Indur and the rest were urged forward by their leaders
wondering at the same time at the scene in which they were engaged,
so contrary to their nature and manners. Presently, all was involved in
smoke and fire. The elephants advancing, soon put to flight those who
were drawn up before them; but their career was stopped by a battery of
cannon, which played furiously against them. Their vast bodies offered
a fair mark to the balls, which presently struck down some, and wounded
others. Indur received a shot on one of his tusks, which broke it, and
put him to such pain and affright, that, turning about, he ran with all
speed over the plain; and falling in with a body of their own infantry,
he burst through, trampling down whole ranks, and filling them with terror
and confusion. His leader having now lost all command over him, and
finding him hurtful to his own party, applied the sharp instrument he
carried to the nape of his neck, and driving it in with all his force, pierced
his spinal marrow, so that he fell lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the next stage of his existence, Indur, to his great surprise, found
even the vast bulk of the elephant prodigiously exceeded; for he was
now a whale of the largest species, rolling in the midst of the arctic seas.
As he darted along, the lash of his tail made whirlpools in the mighty
deep. When he opened his immense jaws he drew in a flood of brine,
which, on rising to the surface, he spouted out again in a rushing fountain,
that rose high in the air with the noise of a mighty cataract. All the
other inhabitants of the ocean seemed as nothing to him. He swallowed,
almost without knowing it, whole shoals of the smaller kinds; and the
larger swiftly turned aside at his approach. “Now,” he cried to himself,
“whatever other evils await me, I am certainly secure from the molestation
of other animals; for what is the creature that can dare to cope with me,
or measure his strength with mine?” Having said this, he saw swimming
near him a fish not a quarter of his length, armed with a dreadful row of
teeth. This was a grampus, which directly flying upon Indur, fastened
on him, and made his great teeth meet in his flesh. Indur roared with
pain, and lashed the sea, till it was all in a foam, but could neither reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>nor shake off his cruel foe. He rolled over and over, rose and sunk, and
exerted all his boasted strength; but to no purpose. At length, the grampus
quitted his hold, and left him not a little mortified with the adventure.
This was, however, forgotten, and Indur received pleasure from his new
situation, as he roamed through the boundless fields of ocean, now diving
to its very bottom, now shooting swiftly to its surface, and sporting with
his companions in unwieldly gambols. Having chosen a mate, he took
his course with her southward, and, in due time, brought up two young
ones, of whom he was extremely fond. The summer season being
arrived, he more frequently than usual rose to the surface, and basking
in the sunbeams, floated unmoved with a large part of his huge body
above the waves. As he was thus one day enjoying a profound sleep,
he was awakened by a sharp instrument penetrating deep into his back.
Instantly, he sprung away with the swiftness of lightning, and feeling
the weapon still sticking, he dived into the recesses of the deep, and
stayed there till want of air obliged him to ascend to the surface. Here
another harpoon was plunged into him, the smart of which again made
him fly from his unseen foes; but, after a shorter course, he was again
compelled to rise, much weakened by the loss of blood, which, gushing
in a torrent, tinged the waters as he passed. Another wound was inflicted,
which soon brought him almost lifeless to the surface; and the line
fastened to the first harpoon being now pulled in, this enormous creature
was brought, an unresisting prey, to the side of a ship, where he was
soon quietly despatched, and then cut to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soul of this huge carcass had next a much narrower lodging, for
Indur was changed into a bee, which, with a great multitude of its young
companions, was on flight in search of a new settlement, their parents
having driven them out of the hive, which was unable to contain them
all. After a rambling excursion, the queen, by whom all their motions
were directed, settled on the branch of a lofty tree. They all immediately
clustered round her, and soon formed a large black bunch, depending
from the bough. A man presently planting a ladder, ascended with a
beehive, and swept them in. After they were quietly settled in their new
habitation, they were placed on a stand in the garden along with some
other colonies, and left to begin their labours. Every fine morning, as
soon as the sun was up, the greatest part of them sallied forth, and roamed
over the garden and the neighbouring fields in search of fresh and fragrant
flowers. They first collected a quantity of gluey matter, with which
they lined all the inside of their house. Then they brought wax, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>began to make their cells, building them with the utmost regularity,
though it was their first attempt, and they had no teacher. As fast as
they were built, some were filled with liquid honey, gathered from the
nectaries of flowers; and as they filled the cells, they sealed them up
with a thin covering of wax. In other cells, the queen-bee deposited her
eggs, which were to supply a new progeny for the ensuing year. Nothing
could be a more pleasing sight than to behold on a sunshiny day the
insects continually going forth to their labour, while others were as constantly
arriving at the mouth of the hole, either with yellow balls of wax
under their thighs, or full of the honey which they had drawn in with
their trunks for the purpose of spouting it out into the cells of the honeycomb.
Indur felt much delight in this useful and active way of life, and
was always one of the first abroad at the dawn, and latest home in
the evening. On rainy and foggy days they stayed at home, and employed
themselves in finishing their cells, and all the necessary work within
doors; and Indur, though endued with human reason, could not but admire
the readiness with which he and the rest formed the most regular plans of
work, all corresponding in design and execution, guided by instinct alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The end of autumn now approaching, the bees had filled their combs
with honey; and nothing more being to be got abroad, they stayed within
doors, passing most of their time in sleep. They ate a little of their
store, but with great frugality; and all their meals were made in public,
none daring to make free with the common stock by himself. The owner
of the hives now came and took them one by one into his hand, that
he might judge by the weight whether or no they were full of honey.
That in which Indur was, proved to be one of the heaviest; and it was
therefore resolved to take the contents. For this purpose, one cold night,
when the bees were all fast asleep, the hive was placed over a hole in
the ground, in which were put brimstone matches set on fire. The fumes
rose into the hive, and soon suffocated great part of the bees, and stupified
the rest, so that they all fell from the combs. Indur was among the dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>He soon revived in the form of a young rabbit in a spacious warren.
This was like a populous town; being everywhere hollowed by burrows
running deep under ground, and each inhabited by one or more families.
In the evening the warren was covered with a vast number of rabbits,
old and young, some feeding, others frisking about, and pursuing one
another in wanton sport. At the least alarm, they all hurried into the
holes nearest them, and were in an instant safe from enemies, who either
could not follow them at all or, if they did, were foiled in the chase by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the numerous ways and turnings in the earth, communicating with each
other, so as to afford easy means of escape. Indur delighted much in this
secure and social life; and taking a mate, was soon the father of a numerous
offspring. Several of the little ones, however, not being sufficiently careful,
fell a prey either to hawks and crows, continually hovering over the
warren, or to cats, foxes, and other wild quadrupeds, who used every art
to catch them at a distance from their holes. Indur himself ran several
hazards. He was once very near being caught by a little dog trained for
the purpose, who kept playing round for a considerable time, not seeming
to attend to the rabbits, till having got near, he all at once darted into the
midst of them. Another time he received some shot from a sportsman
who lay on the watch behind a hedge adjoining the warren.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of rabbits here was so great, that a hard winter coming
on, which killed most of the vegetables, or buried them deep under the
snow, they were reduced to great straits, and many were famished to
death. Some turnips and hay, however, which were laid for them,
preserved the greater part. The approach of spring renewed their sport
and pleasure; and Indur was made the father of another family. One
night, however, was fatal to them all. As they were sleeping, they were
alarmed by the attack of a ferret; and running with great speed to the
mouth of their burrow to escape it, they were all caught in nets placed
over their holes. Indur, with the rest, was despatched by a blow on the
back of the neck, and his body was sent to the nearest market-town.</p>

<p class='c000'>His next change was into a young mastiff, brought up in a farmyard.
Having nearly acquired his full size, he was sent as a present to a
gentleman in the neighbourhood, who wanted a faithful guard for his
house and grounds. Indur presently attached himself to his master and
all his family, and showed every mark of a noble and generous nature.
Though fierce as a lion whenever he thought the persons or property of
his friends invaded, he was as gentle as a lamb at other times, and would
patiently suffer any kind of freedoms from those he loved. He permitted
the children of the house to lug him about, ride on his back, and use him
as roughly as their little hands were capable of; never, even when hurt,
showing any displeasure further than by a low growl. He was extremely
indulgent to all the other animals of his species in the yard; and when
abroad would treat the impertinent barking of little dogs with silent
contempt. Once, indeed, being provoked beyond bearing, not only by
the noise, but by the snaps of a malicious whelp, he suddenly seized him
in his open mouth; but when the bystanders thought that the poor cur was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>going instantly to be destroyed, they were equally diverted and pleased
at seeing Indur go to the side of a muddy ditch, and drop his antagonist
unhurt into the middle of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had, however, more serious conflicts frequently to sustain. He
was accustomed to attend the servant on market-days to the neighbouring
town, when it was his office to guard the provision cart, while the man
was making his purchases in the shops. On these occasions the boldest
dogs in the street would sometimes make an onset in a body; and while
some of them were engaging Indur, others would be mounting the cart,
and pulling down the meat-baskets. Indur had much ado to defend
himself and the baggage, too; however, he never failed to make some of
the assailants pay dearly for their impudence; and by his loud barking,
he summoned his human fellow-servant to his assistance, in time to
prevent their depredations.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length, his courage was exerted on the most important service to
which it could be applied. His master returning home late one evening,
was attacked near his own house by three armed ruffians. Indur heard
his voice calling for help, and instantly flew to his relief. He seized one
of the villains by the throat, brought him to the ground, and presently
disabled him. The master, in the meantime, was keeping off the other
two with a large stick, but had received several wounds with a cutlass;
and one of the men had presented a pistol, and was just on the point of
firing. At this moment, Indur, leaving his vanquished foe on the ground,
rushed forward, and seizing the man’s arm, made him drop the pistol.
The master took it up; on which the other robber fled. He now
advanced to him with whom Indur was engaged, and fired the pistol at
him. The ball broke the man’s arm, and thence entered the body of
Indur, and mortally wounded him. He fell, but had the satisfaction of
seeing his master remain lord of the field; and the servants now coming
up, made prisoners of the two wounded robbers. The master threw
himself by the side of Indur, and expressed the warmest concern at the
accident which had made him the cause of death of the faithful animal
that had preserved his life. Indur died licking his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>So generous a nature was now no longer to be annexed to a brutal
form. Indur awaking as it were from a trance, found himself again in the
happy region he had formerly inhabited, and recommenced the innocent

  <h2 class='c004'>THE GRASS-TRIBE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Tutor</em>—<em>George</em>—<em>Harry</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Harry.</em> Pray, what is that growing on the other side of the hedge?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>George.</em> Why it is corn—don’t you see it is in ear.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes—but it seems too short for corn; and the corn we just now
passed is not in ear by a great deal.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Then I don’t know what it is. Pray, sir, will you tell us?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I don’t wonder you were puzzled about it. It is a sort of grass
sown for hay, and is called rye-grass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But how happens it that it is so very like corn?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> There is no great wonder in that, for all corn is really a kind of
grass; on the other hand, if you were a Lilliputian, every species of grass
would appear to you amazing large corn.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Then there is no difference between corn and grass, but the size?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> None at all.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But we eat corn; and grass is not good to eat.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is only the seeds of corn that we eat: we leave the stalks and
leaves for cows and horses. Now we might eat the seeds of grass, if they
were big enough to be worth gathering; and some particular kinds are in
fact eaten in certain countries.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But are wheat and barley really grass?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—they are a species of that great family of plants, which
botanists call <em>grasses</em>; and I will take this opportunity of telling you
something about them. Go, George, and pull us up a root of that rye-grass.
Harry and I will sit down on this stile till you come to us?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Here is grass enough all round us.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well, then, pull up a few roots that you see in ear.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Here is my grass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And here is mine.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span><em>Tut.</em> Well—spread them all in a handkerchief before us. Now look
at the roots of them all. What do you call them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think they are what you have told us—<em>fibrous</em> roots.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Right—they consist of a bundle of strings. Then look at their
stalks—you will find them jointed and hollow, like the straw of corn.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> So they are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The leaves, you see, of all the kinds are very long and narrow,
tapering to a point at their ends. Those of corn, you know, are the same.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes—they are so like grass at first, that I can never tell the
difference.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Next observe the ears, or heads. Some of these, you see, are
thick, and close, like those of wheat or barley; others are more loose and
open, like oats. The first are generally called <em>spikes</em>; the second <em>panicles</em>.
If you examine them closely, you will find that they all consist of a number
of distinct husky bodies, which are properly the flowers; each of which
is succeeded by a single seed. I dare say you have picked ears of wheat?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> O yes—I am very fond of them!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well then—you found that the grains all lay single, contained
in a scaly husk making a part of the ear, or head. Before the seed was
formed, there was a flower in its place. I do not mean a gay fine-coloured
flower, but a few scales with threads coming out among them, each
crowned with a white tip. And soon after the ears of corn appear you
will find their flowers open, and these white tips coming out of them.
This is the structure of the flowers and flowering heads of every one of
the grass tribe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But what are the <em>beards</em> of corn?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The beards are bristles or points running out from the ends of the
husks. They are properly called <em>awns</em>. Most of the grass-tribe have
something of these, but they are much longer in some kinds than in others.
In barley, you know, they are very long, and give the whole field a sort
of downy or silky appearance, especially when waved by the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Are there the same kinds of corn and grass in all countries?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No. With respect to corn, that is in all countries the product of
cultivation; and different sorts are found best to suit different climates.
Thus, in the northern parts of the temperate zone, oats and rye are chiefly
grown. In the middle and southern, barley and wheat. Wheat is universally
the species preferred for bread-corn; but there are various kinds of
it, differing from each other in size of grain, colour, and other qualities</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span><em>Har.</em> Does not the best wheat of all grow in England?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> By no means. Wheat is better suited to the warmer climates,
and it is only by great attention and upon particular soils that it is made
to succeed well here. On the other hand, the torrid zone is too hot for
wheat and our other grains; and they chiefly cultivate rice there, and
Indian corn.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have seen heads of Indian corn as thick as my wrist, but they
do not look at all like our corn.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—the seeds all grow single in a sort of chaffy head; and the
stalk and leaves resemble those of the grass-tribe, but of a gigantic size.
But there are other plants of this family, which perhaps you have not
thought of.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What are they?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Canes and reeds—from the sugarcanes and bamboo of the tropics,
to the common reed of our ditches, of which you make arrows. All these
have the general character of the grasses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I know that reeds have very fine feathery heads, like the tops of
grass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They have so. And the stalks are composed of many joints; as
are also those of the sugarcane, and of the common cane which grows in
the southern countries of Europe, and of which fishing-rods are often
made, as well as of the bamboo imported hither for walking-sticks, and
applied to many more important uses in the countries of which it is a
native. Some of these are very tall plants, but the seeds of them are
small in proportion, and not useful for food. But there is yet another
kind of grasslike plants common among us.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What is that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Have you not observed in the marshes, and on the sides of ditches,
a coarse broader-leaved sort of grass with large dark-coloured spikes?
This is <em>sedge</em>, in Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">carex</span></i>, and there are many sorts of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What is that good for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is eaten by cattle, both fresh and dry, but is inferior in quality
to good grass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What is it that makes one kind of grass better than another?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> There are various properties which give value to grasses. Some
spread more than others, resist frost and drought better; yield a greater
crop of leaves, and are therefore better for pasturage and hay. The juices
of some are more nourishing and sweet than those of others. In general,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>however, different grasses are suited to different soils; and by improving
soils, the quality of the grass is improved.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Does grass grow in all countries?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—the green turf, which naturally covers fertile soils of all
countries, is chiefly composed of grasses of various kinds. They form,
therefore, the verdant carpet extended over the earth; and humble as
they are, contribute more to beauty and utility, than any other part of the
vegetable creation.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What—more than trees?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, certainly. A land entirely covered with trees would be
gloomy, unwholesome, and scarcely inhabitable; whereas, the meadow,
the down, and the cornfield, afford the most agreeable prospects to the
eye, and furnish every necessary, and many of the luxuries of life. Give
us corn and grass, and what shall we want for food?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Let me see—what should we have? There’s bread and flour for
puddings.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Ay, and milk, for you know cows live on grass and hay—so
there’s cheese and butter and all things that are made of milk.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> And are there not all kinds of meat too, and poultry? And then
for drink, there are beer and ale, which are made from barley. For all
these we are chiefly indebted to <em>the grasses</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Then I am sure we are very much obliged to the grasses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well—let us now walk homeward. Some time hence you shall
make a collection of all the kinds of grasses, and learn to know them from
each other.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>A TEA LECTURE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Tutor</em>—<em>Pupil</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Tutor.</em> Come—the tea is ready. Lay by your book, and let us talk a
little. You have assisted in tea-making a great many times, and yet I
dare say you never considered what kind of an operation it was.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pupil.</em> An operation of cookery—is it not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> You may call it so: but it is properly an operation of <em>chymistry</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Of chymistry! I thought that had been a very deep sort of a
business.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> O—there are many things in common life that belong to the
deepest of sciences. Making tea is the chymical operation called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span><em>infusion</em>, which is, when a hot liquor is poured upon a substance in
order to extract something from it. The water, you see, extracts from
the tea-leaves their colour, taste, and flavour.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Would not cold water do the same?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It would, but more slowly. Heat assists almost all liquors in
their power of extracting the virtues of herbs and other substances.
Thus good housewives were formerly used to boil their tea, in order to
get all goodness from it as completely as possible. The greater heat and
agitation of boiling make it act more powerfully. The liquor in which a
substance has been boiled is called a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">decoction</span></i> of that substance.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Then we had a decoction of mutton at dinner to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> We had—broth is a decoction, and so are gruel and barley-water.
But when anything is put to steep in a cold liquor it is called <em>maceration</em>.
The ingredients of which ink is made are <em>macerated</em>. In all these cases,
you see, the whole substance does not mix with the liquor, but only part
of it. The reason is, that part of it is <em>soluble</em> in the liquor, and part not.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> What is the meaning of that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Solution is when a solid put into a fluid entirely disappears in it,
leaving the liquor clear. Thus when I throw this lump of sugar into my
tea, you see it gradually wastes away till it is all gone, and then I can
taste it in every single drop of my tea; but the tea is as clear as before.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Salt would do the same.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It would. But if I were to throw in a lump of chalk, it would lie
undissolved at the bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> But it would make the water white.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True, while it was stirred; and then it would be a <em>diffusion</em>.
But while the chalk was thus mixed with the liquor, it would lose its
transparency, and not recover it again till, by standing, the chalk had all
subsided and left the liquor as it was before.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> How is the cream mixed with the tea?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Why, that is only <em>diffused</em>, for it takes away the transparency of
the tea. But the particles of cream being finer and lighter than those of
chalk, it remains longer united with the liquor. However, in time the
cream would separate too, and rise to the top, leaving the tea clear.
Now, suppose you had a mixture of sugar, salt, chalk, and tea-leaves,
and were to throw it into water, either hot or cold; what would be the
effect?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> The sugar and salt would be dissolved and disappear. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>tea-leaves would yield their colour and taste. The chalk—I do not
know what would become of that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Why, if the mixture were stirred, the chalk would be diffused
through it, and make it <em>turbid</em> or muddy; but on standing, it would leave
it unchanged.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Then there would remain at bottom the chalk and tea-leaves?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. The clear liquor would contain in <em>solution</em> salt, sugar, and
those particles of the tea in which its colour and taste consisted; the
remainder of the tea and the chalk would lie undissolved.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Then I suppose tea-leaves, after the tea is made, are lighter than
at first.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Undoubtedly. If taken out and dried they would be found to
have lost part of their weight, and the water would have gained it.
Sometimes, however, it is an extremely small portion of a substance
which is soluble, but it is that in which its most remarkable qualities
reside. Thus a small piece of spice will communicate a strong flavour
to a large quantity of liquid, with very little loss of weight.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Will all liquors dissolve the same things?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> By no means. Many dissolve in water that will not in spirit of
wine; and the contrary. And upon this difference many curious matters
in the arts are founded. Thus, spirit-varnish is made of a solution of
various gums or resins in spirits that will not dissolve in water. Therefore,
when it has been laid over any surface with a brush, and is become
dry, the rain or moisture of the air will not affect it. This is the case
with the beautiful varnish laid upon coaches. On the other hand, the
varnish left by gum-water could not be washed off by spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> I remember when I made gum-water, upon setting the cup in a
warm place, it all dried away, and left the gum just as it was before.
Would the same happen if I had sugar or salt dissolved in water?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, upon exposing the solution to warmth, it would dry away,
and you would get back your salt and sugar in a solid state as before.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> But if I were to do so with a cup of tea, what should I get?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Not tea-leaves, certainly! But your question requires a little
previous explanation. It is the property of heat to make most things fly
off in vapour, which is called <em>evaporation</em>, or <em>exhalation</em>. But this it
does in very different degrees to different substances. Some are very
easily made to <em>evaporate</em>; others very difficultly; and others not at all
by the most violent fire we can raise. Fluids in general are easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span><em>evaporable</em>; but not equally so. Spirit of wine flies off in vapour much
sooner than water; so that if you had a mixture of the two, by applying
a gentle heat you might drive off almost all the spirit, while the greater
part of the water would remain. Water, again, is more evaporable than
oil. Some solid substances are much disposed to evaporate: thus,
smelling salts may by a little heat be entirely driven away in the air.
But in general, solids are more <em>fixed</em> than fluids; and, therefore, when a
solid is dissolved in a fluid, it may commonly be recovered again by
evaporation. By this operation common salt is got from seawater and
salt springs, both artificially, and, in hot countries, by the natural heat of
the sun. When the water is no more than is just sufficient to dissolve
the salt, it is called a <em>saturated solution</em>, and on evaporating the water
further, the salt begins to separate, forming little regular masses called
<em>crystals</em>. Sugar may be made in like manner to form crystals, and then
it is sugar-candy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> But what is a sirup?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is when so much sugar is dissolved as sensibly to thicken
the liquor, but not to separate from it. Well—now to your question
about tea. On exposing it to considerable heat, those fine particles in
which its flavour consists, being as <em>volatile</em> or evaporable as the water,
would fly off along with it; and when the liquor came to dryness, there
would be left only those particles in which its roughness and colour
consist. This would make what is called an <em>extract</em> of a plant.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> What becomes of the water that evaporates?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It ascends into the air, and unites with it. But if in its way it
be stopped by any cold body, it is <em>condensed</em>, that is, it returns to the
state of water again. Lift up the lid of the teapot and you will find
water collected on the inside of it, which is condensed steam from the
hot tea beneath. Hold a spoon or knife in the way of the steam which
bursts out of the spout of the teakettle, and you will find it immediately
covered with drops. This operation of turning a fluid into vapour, and
then condensing it, is called <em>distillation</em>. For this purpose, the vessel in
which the liquor is heated is closely covered with another called the head,
into which the steam rises and is condensed. It is then drawn off by
means of a pipe into another vessel called the receiver. In this way all
sweet-scented and aromatic liquors are drawn from fragrant vegetables,
by means of water or spirits. The fragrant part being very volatile rises
along with the steam of the water or spirit, and remains united with it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>after it is condensed. Rosewater, and spirits of lavender, are liquors of
this kind.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Then the water collected on the inside of the teapot-lid should
have the fragrance of the tea.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It should—but unless the tea were fine, you could scarcely
perceive it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> I think I have heard of making salt water fresh by distilling.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. That is an old discovery lately revived. The salt in
seawater, being of a fixed nature, does not rise with the steam; and
therefore, on condensing the steam, the water is found to be fresh. And
this indeed is the method nature employs in raising water by exhalation
from the ocean, which, collecting in clouds, is condensed in the cold region
of the air, and falls down in rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>But our tea is done: so we will now put an end to our chymical lecture.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> But is this real chymistry?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, it is.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pup.</em> Why, I understand it all without any difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I intended you should.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE KIDNAPPERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Mr. B. was accustomed to read in the evening to his young folks some
select story, and then ask them in turn what they thought of it. From
the reflections they made on these occasions, he was enabled to form a
judgment of their dispositions, and was led to throw in remarks of his
own, by which their hearts and understandings might be improved. One
night he read the following narrative from Churchill’s Voyages:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“In some voyages of discovery made from Denmark to Greenland, the
sailors were instructed to seize some of the natives by force or stratagem,
and bring them away. In consequence of these orders, several Greenlanders
were kidnapped and brought to Denmark. Though they were
treated there with kindness, the poor wretches were always melancholy, and
were observed frequently to turn their faces toward the north, and sigh
bitterly. They made several attempts to escape, by putting out to sea in
their little canoes, which had been brought with them. One of them had
got as far as thirty leagues from land before he was overtaken. It was
remarked that this poor man, whenever he met a woman with a child in
her arms, used to utter a deep sigh; whence it was conjectured that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>had left a wife and child behind him. They all pined away one after
another, and died miserably.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, Edward,” said he, “what is your opinion of this story?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> Poor creatures! I think it was barbarous to take them from home.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> It was, indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> Have civilized nations any right to behave so to savages?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> I think you may readily answer that question yourself. Suppose
you were a savage—what would be your opinion?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> I dare say I should think it very wrong. But can savages think
about right and wrong as we do?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Why not? are they not men?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> Yes; but not like civilized men, sure?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> I know no important difference between ourselves and those
people we are pleased to call savage, but in the degree of knowledge and
virtue possessed by each. And I believe many individuals among the
Greenlanders as well as other unpolished people, exceed in these respects
many among us. In the present case I am sure the Danish sailors showed
themselves the greater savages.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> But what did they take away the Greenlanders for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> The pretence was, that they might be brought to be instructed
in a Christian country, and then sent back to civilize their countrymen.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> And was not that a good thing?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Certainly, if it were done by proper means; but to attempt it
by an act of violence and injustice could not be right: for they could
teach them nothing so good as their example was bad; and the poor
people were not likely to learn willingly from those who had begun with
injuring them so cruelly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> I remember Captain Cook, brought over somebody from Otaheite;
and poor Lee Boo was brought here from the Pelew islands. But I
believe they both came of their own accord?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> They did. And it is a great proof of the better way of thinking
of modern voyagers than former ones, that they do not consider it as justifiable
to use violence even for the supposed benefit of the people they visit.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> I have read of taking possession of a newly-discovered country by
setting up the king’s standard or some such ceremony, though it was full
of inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Such was formerly the custom; and a more impudent mockery
of all right and justice can scarcely be conceived. Yet this, I am sorry to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>say, is the title by which European nations claim the greatest part of their
foreign settlements.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ed.</em> And might not the natives drive them out again, if they were able?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> I am sure I do not know why they might not; <em>for force can
never give right</em>. Now, Harry, tell me what <em>you</em> think of the story.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harry.</em> I think it very strange that people should want to go back to
such a cold dismal place as Greenland.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Why what country do you love best in the world?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> England, to be sure!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> But England is by no means the warmest and finest country.
Here are no grapes growing in the fields, nor oranges in the woods and
hedges, as there are in more southern climates.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I should like them very well, to be sure—but then England is my
own native country, where you and mamma and all my friends live.
Besides it is a very pleasant country, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> As to your first reason, you must be sensible that the Greenlander
can say just the same; and the poor fellow who left a wife and
children behind, must have had the strongest of all ties to make him wish
to return. Do you think I should be easy to be separated from all of you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> No; and I am sure we should not be easy, neither.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Home, my dear, wherever it is, is the spot toward which a
good heart is the most strongly drawn. Then, as for the pleasantness of
a place, that all depends upon habit. The Greenlander, being accustomed
to the way of living, and all the objects of his own country, could not
relish any other so well. He loved whale-fat and seal as well as you
can do pudding and beef. He thought rowing his little boat amid the
boisterous waves pleasanter employment than driving a plough or a cart.
He fenced himself against the winter’s cold by warm clothing; and the
long night of many weeks, which you would think so gloomy, was to him
a season of ease and festivity in his habitation underground. It is a very
kind and wise dispensation of Providence, that every part of the world is
rendered most agreeable to those who live in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now little Mary what have you to say?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> I have only to say, that if they were to offer to carry me away
from home, I would scratch their eyes out!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. B.</em> Well said, my girl! stand up for yourself. Let nobody run
away with you—<em>against your will</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> That I won’t.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ON MANUFACTURES.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Father</em>—<em>Henry.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Henry.</em> My dear father, you observed the other day that we had a great
many manufactures in England. Pray, what is a manufacture?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Father.</em> A manufacture is something made by the hand of man. It is
derived from two Latin words, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">manus</span></i>, the hand, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facere</span></i>, to make.
Manufactures are therefore opposed to productions, which latter are what
the bounty of nature spontaneously affords; as fruits, corn, marble.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> But there is a great deal of trouble with corn: you have often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>made me take notice how much pains it costs the farmer to plough his
ground, and put the seed in the earth, and keep it clear from weeds.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Very true: but the farmer does not make the corn; he only prepares
for it a proper soil and situation, and removes every hinderance arising
from the hardness of the ground, or the neighbourhood of other plants,
which might obstruct the secret and wonderful process of vegetation; but
with the vegetation itself he has nothing to do. It is not <em>his</em> hand that draws
out the slender fibres of the root, pushes up the green stalk, and by degrees
the spiky ear; swells the grain, and embrowns it with that rich tinge of
tawny russet, which informs the husbandman it is time to put in his
sickle: all this operation is performed without his care, or even knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Now, then, I understand; corn is a <em>production</em>, and bread is a
<em>manufacture</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Bread is certainly, in strictness of speech, a manufacture; but we
do not in general apply the term to anything in which the original material
is so little changed. If we wanted to speak of bread philosophically, we
should say, it is a preparation of corn.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Is sugar a manufacture?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No, for the same reason. Besides which, I do not recollect the
term being applied to any article of food; I suppose from an idea that
food is of too perishable a nature, and generally obtained by a process too
simple to deserve the name. We say, therefore, sugar-works, oil-mills,
chocolate-works; we do not say a beer-manufactory, but a brewery; but
this is only a nicety of language, for properly all those are manufactories,
if there is much of art and curiosity in the process.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Do we say a manufactory of pictures?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No; but for a different reason. A picture, especially if it belong
to any of the higher kinds of painting, is an effort of genius. A picture
cannot be produced by any given combinations of canvass and colour. It
is the hand, indeed, that executes, but the head that works. Sir Joshua
Reynolds could not have gone, when he was engaged to paint a picture,
and hired workmen, the one to draw the eyes, another the nose, a third
the mouth: the whole must be the painter’s own, that particular painter’s,
and no other; and no one who has not his ideas can do his work. His
work is therefore nobler, of a higher species.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Pray, give me an instance of a manufacture.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> The making of watches is a manufacture: the silver, iron, gold,
or whatever else is used in it, are productions, the materials of the work;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>but it is by the wonderful art of man that they are wrought into the
numberless wheels and springs of which this complicated machine is
composed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Then is there not as much art in making a watch as a picture?
Does not the head work?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Certainly, in the original invention of watches, as much, or more,
than in painting; but when once invented, the art of watchmaking is
capable of being reduced to a mere mechanical labour, which may be
exercised by any man of common capacity, according to certain precise
rules, when made familiar to him by practice: of this painting is not
capable.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> But, my dear father, making books surely requires a great deal
of thinking and study; and yet I remember the other day at dinner a
gentleman said that Mr. Pica had manufactured a large volume in less
than a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It was meant to convey a satirical remark on his book because it
was compiled from other authors, from whom he had taken a page in one
place, and a page in another; so that it was not produced by the labour
of his brain, but of his hands. Thus you heard your mother complain
that the London cream was manufactured; which was a pointed and
concise way of saying that the cream was not what it ought to be, or what
it pretended to be: for cream, when genuine, is a pure production; but
when mixed up and adulterated with flour and isinglass, and I know not
what, it becomes a manufacture. It was as much as to say, art has been
here where it has no business; where it is not beneficial, but hurtful. A
great deal of the delicacy of language depends upon an accurate knowledge
of the specific meaning of single terms, and a nice attention to their
relative propriety.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Have all nations manufactures?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> All that are in any degree cultivated; but it very often happens
that countries naturally the poorest have manufactures of the greatest
extent and variety.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Why so?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> For the same reason, I apprehend, that individuals, who are rich
without any labour of their own, are seldom so industrious and active as
those who depend upon their own exertions: thus the Spaniards, who
possess the richest gold and silver mines in the world, are in want of
many conveniences of life which are enjoyed in London and Amsterdam.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span><em>Hen.</em> I can comprehend that: I believe if my uncle Leger were to
find a gold mine under his warehouse, he would soon shut up his shop.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> I believe so. It is not, however, easy to establish manufactures
in a <em>very poor</em> nation: they require science and genius for their invention,
art and contrivance for their execution; order, peace, and union, for
their flourishing. They require, too, a number of men to combine together
in an undertaking, and to prosecute it with the most patient industry;
they require, therefore, laws and government for their protection. If you
see extensive manufactures in any nation, you may be sure it is a civilized
nation, you may be sure property is accurately ascertained and protected.
They require great expenses for their first establishment, costly machines
for shortening manual labour, and money and credit for purchasing materials
from distant countries. There is not a single manufacture of Great
Britain which does not require, in some part or other of its process,
productions from the different parts of the globe, oils, drugs, varnish,
quicksilver, and the like: it requires, therefore, <em>ships</em> and a friendly
intercourse with foreign nations, to transport commodities and exchange
productions. We could not be a manufacturing, unless we were also a
commercial nation. They require time to take root in any place, and
their excellence often depends upon some nice and delicate circumstance;
a peculiar quality, for instance, in the air or water, or some other local
circumstance not easily ascertained. Thus, I have heard that the Irish
women spin better than the English, because the moister temperature of
their climate makes their skin more soft and their fingers more flexible:
thus again we cannot die so beautiful a scarlet as the French can, though
with the same drugs, perhaps on account of the superior purity of the air.
But though so much is necessary for the perfection of the more curious
and complicated manufactures, all nations possess those which are
subservient to the common conveniences of life;—the loom and the forge,
particularly, are of the highest antiquity.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Yes; I remember Hector bids Andromache return to her apartments,
and employ herself in weaving with her maids; and I remember
the shield of Achilles.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> True; and you likewise remember, in an earlier period, the fine
linen of Egypt: and to go still higher, the working of iron and brass is
recorded of Tubal-Cain before the flood.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Which is the most important, manufactures or agriculture?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Agriculture is the most <em>necessary</em>, because it is first of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>necessary that man should live; but almost all the enjoyments and
comforts of life are produced by manufactures.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Why are we obliged to take so much pains to make ourselves
comfortable?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> To exercise our industry. Nature provides the materials for man.
She pours out at his feet a profusion of gems, metals, dies, plants, ores,
bark, stones, gums, wax, marbles, woods, roots, skins, earth, and minerals
of all kinds! She has likewise given him tools.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> I did not know that nature gave us tools.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No! what are those two instruments you carry always about with
you, so strong and yet so flexible, so nicely jointed, and branched out
into five long, taper, unequal divisions, any of which may be contracted
or stretched out at pleasure; the extremities of which have a feeling so
wonderfully delicate, and which are strengthened and defended by horn?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> The hands?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yes. Man is as much superior to the brutes in his outward form,
by means of the hand, as he is in his mind by the gifts of reason. The
trunk of the elephant comes perhaps the nearest to it in its exquisite
feeling and flexibility, (it is, indeed, called his hand in Latin,) and accordingly
that animal has always been reckoned the wisest of brutes. When
Nature gave man the hand, she said to him. “Exercise your ingenuity
and work.” As soon as ever a man rises above the state of a savage, he
begins to contrive and to make things, in order to improve his forlorn
condition: thus you may remember Thomson represents Industry coming
to the poor shivering wretch, and teaching him the arts of life:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Taught him to chip the wood, and hew the stone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till by degrees the finished fabric rose;</div>
      <div class='line'>Tore from his limbs the bloody-polluted fur,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wrapped them in the woolly vestment warm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or bright in glossy silk and flowing lawn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> It must require a great deal of knowledge, I suppose, for so many
curious works; what kind of knowledge is most necessary?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> There is not any which may not be occasionally employed; but
the two sciences which most assist the manufacturer are <em>mechanics</em> and
<em>chymistry</em>; the one for building mills, working mines, and in general for
constructing wheels, wedges, pulleys, &amp;c., either to shorten the labour of
man, by performing it in less time, or to perform what the strength of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>man alone could not accomplish; the other in fusing and working ores,
in dying and bleaching, and extracting the virtues of various substances
for particular uses; making of soap, for instance, is a chymical operation;
and by chymistry an ingenious gentleman has lately found out a way of
bleaching a piece of cloth in eight-and-forty hours, which by the common
process would have taken up a great many weeks. You have heard of
Sir Richard Arkwright, who died lately?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Yes, I have heard he was at first only a barber, and shaved
people for a penny apiece.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> He did so; but having a strong turn for mechanics, he invented,
or at least perfected a machine, by which one pair of hands may do the
work of twenty or thirty; and, as in this country every one is free to rise
by merit, he acquired the largest fortune in the country, had a great many
hundreds of workmen under his orders, and had leave given him by the
king to put <em>Sir</em> before his name.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Did that do him any good?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It pleased him, I suppose, or he would not have accepted of it;
and you will allow, I imagine, that if titles are used, it does honour to
those who bestow them, when they are given to such as have made themselves
noticed for something useful. Arkwright used to say, that if he
had time to perfect his inventions, he would put a fleece of wool into a
box, and it should come out broadcloth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> What did he mean by that? Was there any fairy in the box to
turn it into broadcloth with her wand?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> He was assisted by the only fairies that ever had the power of
transformation—art and industry: he meant that he would contrive so
many machines, wheel within wheel, that the combing, carding, and
various other operations, should be performed by mechanism, almost
without the hand of man.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> I think, if I had not been told, I should never have been able to
guess that my coat came off the back of the sheep.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> You hardly would; but there are manufactures in which the
material is much more changed than in woollen cloth. What can be
meaner in appearance than sand and ashes? Would you imagine anything
beautiful could be made out of such a mixture? Yet the furnace
transforms this into that transparent crystal we call glass, than which
nothing is more sparkling, more brilliant, more full of lustre. It throws
about the rays of light as if it had life and motion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span><em>Hen.</em> There is a glass shop in London which always puts me in mind
of Aladdin’s palace.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It is certain that if a person, ignorant of the manufacture, were to
see one of our capital shops, he would think all the treasures of Golconda
were centred there, and that every drop of cut-glass was worth a prince’s
ransom. Again, who would suppose, on seeing the green stalks of a plant,
that it could be formed into a texture so smooth, so snowy-white, so firm,
and yet so flexible as to wrap round the limbs, and adapt itself to every
movement of the body? Who would guess this fibrous stalk could be
made to float in such light undulating folds as in our lawns and cambrics;
not less fine, we presume, than that transparent drapery which the Romans
called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ventus textilis</span></i>, <em>woven wind</em>?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> I wonder how anybody can spin such fine thread!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Their fingers must have the touch of a spider, that, as Pope says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Feels at each thread, and lives along the line;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and, indeed, you recollect that Arachne was a spinster. Lace is a still
finer production from flax, and is one of those in which the original
material is most improved. How many times the price of a pound of flax
do you think that flax will be worth when made into lace?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> A great many times, I suppose.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Flax at the best hand is bought at fourteen pence a pound. They
make lace at Valenciennes, in French Flanders, of ten guineas a yard—I
believe, indeed, higher—but we will say ten guineas; this yard of lace
will weigh probably more than half an ounce: what is the value of half
an ounce of flax?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> It comes to one farthing and three quarters of a farthing.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Right: now tell me how many times the original value the lace is
worth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Prodigious! it is worth 5760 times as much as the flax it is made of!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yet there is another material that is still more improveable than flax.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> What can that be?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Iron. The price of pig-iron is ten shillings a hundred weight;
this is not quite one farthing for two ounces: now you have seen some
of the beautiful cut-steel that looks like diamonds?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Yes, I have seen buckles, and pins, and watchchains.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Then you can form an idea of it: but you have only seen the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>most common sorts. There was a chain made at Woodstock, in Oxford
shire, and sent to France, which weighed only two ounces, and cost 170<em>l.</em>
Calculate how many times that had increased its value.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Amazing! it was worth 163,600 times the value of the iron it
was made of!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> That is what manufacture can do: here man is a kind of creator
and, like the great Creator, he may please himself with his work, and say
it is good. In the last-mentioned manufacture, too, that of steel, the
English have the honour of excelling all the world.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> What are the chief manufactures of England?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> We have at present a greater variety than I can pretend to
enumerate, but our staple manufacture is woollen cloth. England abounds
in fine pastures and extensive downs, which feed great numbers of sheep:
hence our wool has always been a valuable article of trade; but we did
not always know how to work it. We used to sell it to the Flemish or
Lombards, who wrought it into cloth; till, in the year 1326, Edward the
Third invited some Flemish weavers over to teach us the art; but there
was not much made in England till the reign of Henry the Seventh.
Manchester and Birmingham are towns which have arisen to great consequence
from small beginnings, almost within the memory of old men
now living; the first for cotton and muslin goods, the second for cutlery
and hardware, in which we at this moment excel all Europe. Of late
years, too, carpets, beautiful as fine tapestry, have been fabricated in this
country. Our clocks and watches are greatly esteemed. The earthenware
plates and dishes, which we all use in common, and the elegant set for
the tea-table, ornamented with musical instruments, which we admired
in our visit yesterday, belong to a very extensive manufactory, the seat
of which is at Burslem, in Staffordshire. The principal potteries there
belong to one person, an excellent chymist, and a man of great taste; he,
in conjunction with another man of taste, who is since dead, has made
our clay more valuable than the finest porcelain of China. He has moulded
it into all the forms of grace and beauty that are to be met with in the
precious remains of the Greek and Etruscan artists. In the more common
articles he has pencilled it with the most elegant designs, shaped it into
shells and leaves, twisted it into wickerwork, and trailed the ductile
foliage round the light basket. He has filled our cabinets and chimney-pieces
with urns, lamps, and vases, on which are lightly traced, with the
purest simplicity, the fine forms and floating draperies of Herculaneum.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>In short, he has given to our houses a classic air, and has made every
saloon and every dining-room schools of taste. I should add that there is
a great demand abroad for this elegant manufacture. The emperess of
Russia has some magnificent services of it; and the other day one was
sent to the king of Spain, intended as a present from him to the archbishop
of Toledo, which cost a thousand pounds. Some morning you
shall go through the rooms in the London warehouse.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> I should like very much to see manufactures, now you have told
me some curious things about them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> You will do well! There is much more entertainment to a
cultivated mind in seeing a pin made, than in many a fashionable diversion
which young people half ruin themselves to attend. In the meantime I will
give you some account of one of the most elegant of them, which is <em>paper</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hen.</em> Pray do, my dear father.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It shall be left for another evening, however, for it is now late.

  <h2 class='c004'>A LESSON IN THE ART OF DISTINGUISHING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Father.</em> Come hither, Charles; what is that you see grazing in the
meadow before you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Charles.</em> It is a horse.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Whose horse is it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I do not know; I never saw it before.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> How do you know it is a horse, if you never saw it before?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Because it is like other horses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Are all horses alike, then?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span><em>Ch.</em> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> If they are alike, how do you know one horse from another?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> They are not quite alike.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> But they are so much alike, that you can easily distinguish a horse
from a cow?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Or from a cabbage?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> A horse from a cabbage? yes, surely I can.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Very well; then let us see if you can tell how a horse differs from
a cabbage?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Very easily; a horse is alive?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> True; and how is every thing called which is alive?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I believe all things that are alive are called <em>animals</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Right; but can you tell me what a horse and a cabbage are
alike in?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Nothing, I believe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yes, there is one thing in which the slenderest moss that grows
upon the wall is like the greatest man or the highest angel.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Because God made them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yes: and how do you call everything that is made?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> A creature.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> A horse, then, is a creature, but also a living creature; that is to
say, an animal.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> And a cabbage is a dead creature: that is the difference.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Not so, neither; nothing is dead that has never been alive.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> What must I call it, then, if it is neither dead nor alive?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> An inanimate creature; there is the animate and inanimate
creation. Plants, stones, metals, are of the latter class; horses belong
to the former.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But the gardener told me some of my cabbages were <em>dead</em>, and some
were <em>alive</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Very true. Plants have a <em>vegetative</em> life, a principle of growth
and decay; this is common to them with all organized bodies; but they
have not sensation, at least we do not know they have—they have not
life, therefore in the sense in which animals enjoy it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> A horse is called an animal, then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yes; but a salmon is an animal; and so is a sparrow; how will
you distinguish a horse from these?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span><em>Ch.</em> A salmon lives in the water, and swims; a sparrow flies and lives
in the air.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> I think a salmon could not walk on the ground, even if it could
live out of the water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No, indeed, it has no legs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And a bird cannot gallop like a horse.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No; It hops upon its two slender legs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> How many legs has a horse?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Four.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And an ox?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Four likewise.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And a camel?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Four still.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Do you know any animals which live upon the earth that have not
four legs?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I think not; they have all four legs, except worms and insects, and
such things.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> You remember, I suppose, what an animal is called that has four
legs; you have it in your little books?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> A quadruped.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> A horse then, is a <em>quadruped</em>: by this we distinguish him from
birds, fishes, and insects.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> And from men.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> True; but if you had been talking about birds, you would not have
found it so easy to distinguish them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> How so? a man is not at all like a bird.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yet an ancient philosopher could find no way to distinguish them,
but by calling man a <em>two-legged animal without feathers</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I think he was very silly; they are not at all alike, though they
have both two legs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Another ancient philosopher, called Diogenes, was of your opinion.
He stripped a cock of his feathers, and turned him into the school where
Plato, that was his name, was teaching, and said, “Here is Plato’s man
for you!”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I wish I had been there, I should have laughed very much.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Probably. Before we laugh at others, however, let us see what
we can do ourselves. We have not yet found anything which will distinguish
a horse from an elephant, or from a Norway rat.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span><em>Ch.</em> Oh, that is easy enough! An elephant is very large, and a rat is
very small; a horse is neither large nor small.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Before we go any farther look what is settled on the skirt of your
coat.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> It is a butterfly: what a prodigiously large one! I never saw such
a one before.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Is it larger than a rat, think you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No, that it is not.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yet you called the butterfly large, and you called the rat small.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> It is very large for a butterfly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It is so. You see, therefore, that large and small are <em>relative
terms</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I do not well understand that phrase.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It means that they have no precise and determinate signification
in themselves, but are applied differently according to the other ideas
which you join with them, and the different positions in which you view
them. This butterfly, therefore, is <em>large</em>, compared with those of its own
species, and <em>small</em> compared with many other species of animals. Besides,
there is no circumstance which varies more than the size of individuals.
If you were to give an idea of a horse from its size, you would
certainly say it was much bigger than a dog; yet if you take the smallest
Shetland horse, and the largest Irish greyhound, you will find them very
much upon a par; size, therefore, is not a circumstance by which you
can accurately distinguish one animal from another; nor yet is colour.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No; there are black horses, and bay, and white, and pied.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> But you have not seen that variety of colours in a hare for instance.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No, a hare is always brown.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yet if you were to depend upon that circumstance, you would not
convey the idea of a hare to a mountaineer, or an inhabitant of Siberia;
for he sees them white as snow. We must, therefore find out some circumstances
that do not change like size and colour, and I may add shape,
though they are not so obvious, nor perhaps so striking. Look at the feet
of quadrupeds; are they all alike?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No: some have long taper claws, and some have thick clumsy
feet without claws.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> The thick feet are horny: are they not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Yes, I recollect they are called hoofs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And the feet that are not covered with horn and are divided into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>claws, are called <em>digitated</em>, from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">digitus</span></i>, a finger; because they are
parted like fingers. Here, then, we have one grand division of quadrupeds
into <em>hoofed</em> and <em>digitated</em>. Of which division is the horse?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> He is hoofed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> There are a great many different kinds of horses; did you ever
know one that was not hoofed?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No, never.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Do you think we run any hazard of a stranger telling us, “Sir,
horses are hoofed indeed in your country; but in mine, which is in a different
climate, and where we feed them differently, they have claws?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No, I dare say not.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Then we have got something to our purpose; a circumstance
easily marked, which always belongs to the animal, under every variation
of situation or treatment. But an ox is hoofed, and so is a sheep; we
must distinguish still farther. You have often stood by, I suppose, while
the smith was shoeing a horse. What kind of a hoof has he?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> It is round and all in one piece.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And is that of an ox so?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> No, it is divided.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> A horse, then, is not only hoofed but <em>whole-hoofed</em>. Now how
many quadrupeds do you think there are in the world that are whole-hoofed?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Indeed I do not know.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> There are, among all animals that we are acquainted with, either
in this country or in any other, only the horse, the ass, and the zebra,
which is a species of the wild ass. Now, therefore, you see we have
nearly accomplished our purpose; we have only to distinguish him from
the ass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> That is easily done, I believe; I should be sorry if any body could
mistake my little horse for an ass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It is not so easy, however, as you imagine; the eye readily distinguishes
them by the air and general appearance, but naturalists have
been rather puzzled to fix upon any specific difference, which may serve
the purpose of a definition. Some have, therefore, fixed upon the ears,
others on the mane and tail. What kind of ears has an ass?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Oh, very long clumsy ears! Asses’ ears are always laughed at.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And the horse?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> The horse has small ears, nicely turned and upright.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span><em>Fa.</em> And the mane, is there no difference there?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> The horse has a fine long flowing mane; the ass has hardly any.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And the tail: is it not fuller of hair in the horse than in the ass?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Yes; the ass has only a few long hairs at the end of the tail; but
the horse has a long bushy tail when it is not cut.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Which, by the way, it is a pity it ever should. Now, then, observe
what particulars we have got. <em>A horse is an animal of the quadruped
kind, whole-hoofed, with short erect ears, a flowing mane, and a tail
covered in every part with long hairs.</em> Now is there any other animal,
think you, in the world, that answers these particulars?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I do not know; this does not tell us a great deal about him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And yet it tells us enough to distinguish him from all the different
tribes of the creation which we are acquainted with in any part of the
earth. Do you know now what we have been making?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> What?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> <span class='sc'>A Definition.</span> It is the business of a definition to distinguish
precisely the thing defined from any other thing, and to do it in as few
terms as possible. Its object is to separate the subject of definition, first
from those with which it has only a general resemblance, then, from those
which agree with it in a greater variety of particulars; and so on till by
constantly throwing out all which have not the qualities we have taken
notice of, we come at length to the individual or the species we wish to
ascertain. It is a kind of chase, and resembles the manner of hunting in
some countries, where they first enclose a large circle with their dogs,
nets, and horses; and then, by degrees, draw their toils closer and closer,
driving their game before them till it is at length brought into so narrow a
compass that the sportsmen have nothing to do but to knock down their
prey.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Just as we have been hunting this horse, till at last we held him
fast by his ears and tail.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> I should observe to you, that in the definition naturalists give of a
horse it is generally mentioned that he has six cutting teeth in each jaw;
because this circumstance of the teeth has been found a very convenient
one for characterizing large classes: but as it is not absolutely necessary
here, I have omitted it; a definition being the most perfect the fewer
particulars you make use of, provided you can say with certainty from
those particulars the object so characterized must be this and no other
whatever.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span><em>Ch.</em> But, papa, if I had never seen a horse, I should not know what
kind of animal it was by this definition.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Let us hear, then, how you would give me an idea of a horse.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I would say it was a fine large prancing creature with slender legs
and an arched neck, and a sleek, smooth skin, and a tail that sweeps the
ground, and that he snorts and neighs very loud, and tosses his head, and
runs as swift as the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> I think you learned some verses upon the horse in your last lesson?
Repeat them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em></p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> You have said very well; but this is not a <em>definition</em>, it is a
<em>description</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> What is the difference?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> A description is intended to give you a lively picture of an object,
as if you saw it; it ought to be very full. A definition gives no picture
to those who have not seen it: it rather tells you what its subject is not,
than what it is, by giving you such clear specific marks, that it shall not
be possible to confound it with anything else; and hence it is of the
greatest use in throwing things into classes. We have a great many
beautiful descriptions from ancient authors so loosely worded that we
cannot certainly tell what animals are meant by them: whereas, if they
had given us definitions, three lines would have ascertained their meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I like a description best, papa.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Perhaps so; I believe I should have done the same at your age.
Remember, however, that nothing is more useful than to learn to form
ideas with precision, and to express them with accuracy; I have not given
you a definition to teach you what a horse is, but to teach you to <em>think</em>.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE PHENIX AND DOVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A Phenix, who had long inhabited the solitary deserts of Arabia, once
flew so near the habitations of men as to meet with a tame dove, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>was sitting on her nest, with wings expanded, and fondly brooding over
her young ones, while she expected her mate, who was foraging abroad
to procure them food. The phenix, with a kind of insulting compassion,
said to her, “Poor bird, how much I pity thee! confined to a single spot,
and sunk in domestic cares, thou art continually employed either in laying
eggs or providing for thy brood; and thou exhausteth thy life and strength
in perpetuating a feeble and defenceless race. As to myself, I live exempt
from toil, care, and misfortune. I feed upon nothing less precious than
rich gums and spices. I fly through the trackless regions of the air, and
when I am seen by men, am gazed at with curiosity and astonishment!
I have no one to control my range, no one to provide for; and when I
have fulfilled my five centuries of life, and seen the revolution of ages, I
rather vanish than die, and a successor, without my care, springs up from
my ashes. I am an image of the great sun whom I adore; and glory in
being like him, single and alone, and having no likeness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The dove replied, “O, phenix, I pity thee much more than thou affectest
to pity me! What pleasure canst thou enjoy, who livest forlorn and
solitary in a trackless and unpeopled desert? who hast no mate to caress
thee, no young ones to excite thy tenderness and reward thy cares, no
kindred, no society among thy fellows? Not long life only, but
immortality itself would be a curse, if it were to be bestowed on such
uncomfortable terms. For my part, I know that my life will be short,
and therefore I employ it in raising a numerous posterity, and in opening
my heart to all the sweets of domestic happiness. I am beloved by my
partner; I am dear to man; and shall leave marks behind me that I have
lived. As to the sun, to whom thou hast presumed to compare thyself,
that glorious being is so totally different from, and so infinitely superior
to, all the creatures upon earth, that it does not become us to liken
ourselves to him, or to determine upon the manner of his existence.
One obvious difference, however, thou mayest remark; that the sun,
though alone, by his prolific heat produces all things, and though he
shines so high above our heads, gives us reason every moment to bless
his beams; whereas thou, swelling with imaginary greatness, dreamest
away a long period of existence, equally void of comfort and of usefulness.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE MANUFACTURE OF PAPER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Father.</em> I will now, as I promised, give you an account of the elegant
and useful manufacture of <em>paper</em>, the basis of which is itself a manufacture.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>This delicate and beautiful substance is made from the meanest
and most disgusting materials, from old rags, which have passed from
one poor person to another, and have perhaps at length dropped in tatters
from the child of the beggar. These are carefully picked up from dunghills,
or bought from servants by Jews, who make it their business to go
about and collect them. They sell them to the rag-merchant, who gives
them from two pence to four pence a pound, according to their quality;
and he, when he has got a sufficient quantity, disposes of them to the
owner of the papermill. He gives them first to women to sort and pick,
agreeably to their different degrees of fineness; they also with a knife cut
out carefully all the seams, which they throw into a basket for other purposes;
they then put them into the dusting-engine, a large circular wire
sieve, where they receive some degree of cleansing. The rags are then
conveyed to the mill. Here they were formerly beat to pieces with vast
hammers, which rose and fell continually with a most tremendous noise,
that was heard at a great distance. But now they put the rags into a
large trough or cistern, into which a pipe of clear spring water is constantly
flowing. In this cistern is placed a cylinder, about two feet long,
set thick round with rows of iron spikes, standing as near as they can to
one another without touching. At the bottom of the trough there are
corresponding rows of spikes. The cylinder is made to whirl round with
inconceivable rapidity, and with these iron teeth rends and tears the cloth
in every possible direction; till, by the assistance of the water, which
continually flows through the cistern, it is thoroughly masticated, and
reduced to a fine pulp; and by the same process all its impurities are
cleansed away, and it is restored to its original whiteness. This process
takes about six hours. To improve the colour they then put in a little
smalt, which gives it a bluish cast, which all paper has more or less: the
French paper has less of it than ours. This fine pulp is next put into a
copper of warm water. It is the substance of paper, but the form must
now be given it: for this purpose they use a mould. It is made of wire,
strong one way, and crossed with finer. This mould they just dip horizontally
into the copper and take it out again. It has a little wooden
frame on the edge, by means of which it retains as much of the pulp as
is wanted for the thickness of the sheet, and the water runs off through
the interstices of the wires. Another man instantly receives it, opens the
frame, and turns out the thin sheet, which has now shape, but not
consistence, upon soft felt, which is placed on the ground to receive it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>On that is placed another piece of felt, and then another sheet of paper,
and so on, till they have made a pile of forty or fifty. They are then
pressed with a large screw-press, moved by a long lever, which forcibly
squeezes the water out of them, and gives them immediate consistence.
There is still, however, a great deal to be done. The felts are taken off,
and thrown on one side, and the paper on the other, whence it is dexterously
taken up with an instrument in the form of a T, three sheets at a
time, and hung on lines to dry. There it hangs for a week or ten days,
which likewise further whitens it; and any knots and roughness it may
have are picked off carefully by the women. It is then sized. Size is a
kind of glue; and without this preparation the paper would not bear ink;
it would run and blot as you see it does on gray paper. The sheets are
just dipped into the size and taken out again. The exact degree of sizing
is a matter of nicety, which can only be known by experience. They are
then hung up again to dry, and when dry, taken to the finishing-room,
where they are examined anew, pressed in the dry-presses, which give
them their last gloss and smoothness; counted up into quires, made up
into reams, and sent to the stationer’s, from whom we have it, after he has
folded it again and cut the edges; some too he makes to shine like satin,
by hot-pressing it, or glossing it with hot plates. The whole process of
papermaking takes about three weeks.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> It is a very curious process indeed. I shall almost scruple for the
future to blacken a sheet of paper with a careless scrawl, now I know
how much pains it costs to make it so white and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It is true that there is hardly anything we use with so much waste and
profusion as this manufacture: we should think ourselves confined in the
use of it, if we might not tear, disperse, and destroy it in a thousand ways;
so that it is really astonishing whence linen enough can be procured to
answer so vast a demand. As to the coarse brown papers, of which an
astonishing quantity is used by every shopkeeper in packages, &amp;c., these
are made chiefly of oakum, that is, old hempen ropes. A fine paper is
made in China of silk.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I have heard lately of woven paper; pray, what is that? they
cannot weave paper, surely!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Your question is very natural. In order to answer it, I must desire
you to take a sheet of common paper, and hold it up against the light.
Do not you see marks in it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I see a great many white lines running along lengthwise, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>ribs, and smaller that cross them. I see, too, letters and the figure of a
crown.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> These are all the marks of the wires; the thickness of the wire
prevents so much of the pulp lying upon the sheet in those places,
consequently wherever the wires are the paper is thinner, and you see
the light through more readily, which gives that appearance of white lines.
The letters, too, are worked in the wire, and are the maker’s name. Now, to
prevent these lines, which take off from the beauty of the paper, particularly
of drawing-paper, there have been lately used moulds of brass wire,
exceeding fine, of equal thickness, and woven or latticed one within another:
the marks therefore of these are easily pressed out, so as to be hardly
visible; if you look at this sheet you will see it is quite smooth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> It is so.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> I should mention to you, that there is a discovery very lately made,
by which they can make paper equal to any in whiteness, of the coarsest
brown rags, and even of died cotton; which they have till now been
obliged to throw by for inferior purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> That is like what you told me before of bleaching cloth in a few
hours.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It is indeed founded upon the same discovery. The paper made of
these brown rags is likewise more valuable, from being very tough and
strong, almost like parchment.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> When was the making of paper found out?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> It is a disputed point, but probably in the fourteenth century. The
invention has been of almost equal consequence to literature with that of
printing itself; and shows how the arts and sciences, like children of the
same family, mutually assist and bring forward each other.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE TWO ROBBERS.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c012'>Scene—<em>Alexander the Great in his tent. Guards. A man with a fierce countenance, chained and fettered, brought before him.</em></h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Alex.</em> What, art thou the Thracian robber of whose exploits I have
heard so much?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> I am a Thracian and a soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> A soldier!—a thief, a plunderer, an assassin! the pest of the country!
could honour thy courage, but I must detest and punish thy crimes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>R.</em> What have I done, of which <em>you</em> can complain?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span><em>A.</em> Hast thou not set at defiance my authority, violated the public peace,
and passed thy life in injuring the persons and properties of thy fellow-subjects?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>R.</em> Alexander, I am your captive—I must hear what you please to say,
and endure what you please to inflict. But my soul is unconquered; and
if I reply at all to your reproaches, I will reply like a free man.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> Speak freely. Far be it from me to take the advantage of my
power to silence those with whom I deign to converse!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>R.</em> I must then answer your question by another. How have <em>you</em> passed
your life?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> Like a hero. Ask Fame and she will tell you. Among the brave,
I have been the bravest; among sovereigns, the noblest; among conquerors,
the mightiest.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>R.</em> And does not fame speak of me, too? Was there ever a bolder
captain of a more valiant band? Was there ever—but I scorn to boast.
You yourself know that I have not been easily subdued.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> Still, what are you but a robber—a base dishonest robber?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>R.</em> And what is a conqueror? Have not you, too, gone about the earth
like an evil genius, blasting the fair fruits of peace and industry;—plundering,
ravaging, killing without law, without justice, merely to
gratify an insatiable lust for dominion? All that I have done to a single
district with a hundred followers, you have done to whole nations with a
hundred thousand. If I have stripped individuals, you have ruined kings
and princes. If I have burnt a few hamlets, you have desolated the
most flourishing kingdoms and cities of the earth. What is then the
difference, but that as you were born a king, and I a private man, you
have been able to become a mightier robber than I?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> But if I have taken like a king, I have given like a king. If I have
subverted empires, I have founded greater. I have cherished arts,
commerce, and philosophy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>R.</em> I, too, have freely given to the poor what I took from the rich. I
have established order and discipline among the most ferocious of mankind;
and have stretched out my protecting arm over the oppressed. I
know, indeed, little of the philosophy you talk of; but I believe neither
you nor I shall ever repay to the world the mischiefs we have done it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>A.</em> Leave me—take off his chains, and use him well. (<em>Exit robber.</em>)
Are we then so much alike?—Alexander to a robber?—Let me reflect.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE COUNCIL OF QUADRUPEDS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Among the large branches of an aged oak, which grew in the midst of
a thick wood, lived once upon a time a wildcat. In that tree she was
born and brought up, and had nursed many litters of kittens; her mother
and her grandmother, had lived there before her; indeed, I believe that,
as long as the oak had been an oak, this family of wildcats had made it
their home.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, as she was couching among some bushes near the foot of
her tree, watching her opportunity to spring upon any poor little bird
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>who might happen to alight within her reach, she heard a great rustling
in the thicket, and presently two men pushed their way through, and
stood before her. This part of the forest was so tangled and wild, and so
far from any human habitation, that it was a rare thing to see men there,
and the cat wondered very much why they came; so she lay quite still in
her hiding-place, watching them and listening to hear what they should
say. She soon discovered that they were woodcutters, for each was
armed with an axe, which he carried upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently one said to his fellow, “Is it all to be cut down?”—“All the
whole forest,” answered the other, “and the ground is to be ploughed up
and sown with corn, but the largest trees are to be felled first.”—“If that
be the case,” said the first, “we cannot begin better than with this noble
oak before us, and I will put a mark on it that we may know it again.”
So saying, he pulled out a piece of chalk, and made a large white cross
on the bark of the poor cat’s own tree. “Next week,” added he, “we will
lay the axe to the root.” And he walked on, whistling with great unconcern.</p>

<p class='c000'>The unfortunate cat lay a long time on the ground, half dead with grief
and terror, and unable to move a limb. At length, after uttering several
cries so loud and shrill that the whole forest seemed to ring again, she
started up, and ran like one distracted to spread the dismal news among
her neighbours of the wood. The first creature that she met was the stag:
he had just started up from his lair, amid the thickest cover, and stood
listening, ready to bound away on the first appearance of danger. “Was
it you, neighbour puss,” cried he, “who set up that frightful yell which I
heard? I almost thought the hounds and hunters were upon me;—but
what is the matter?”—“Matter enough,” answered the cat; “worse than
either hounds or hunters; the forest is to be cut down.” And she told
him her sad story. “The forest cut down!” brayed out the poor stag,
while the tears ran in large drops down his hairy face; “and what is to
become of me and you, and all our neighbours? Man has always been
my enemy, but this is a stroke of cruelty which I did not expect even from
him. Is there no help, no remedy?”—“I will fight for my tree,” cried
the cat, “as long as teeth and claws hold good: and you with your great
horns may surely defend your own thicket; but this <em>man</em> is a terrible
creature, and he has so many crafty tricks, that I know nobody, except the
fox, who is at all a match for him; suppose we run and ask his advice.”
“With all my heart,” said the stag; and they marched away together in
search of him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The fox had his abode near the skirts of the forest, in the middle of a
dry bank, thickly covered with bushes and brambles. His hole was burrowed
deep into the earth, and cunningly contrived with several openings
on different sides, by which he might make his escape in case of danger.
The cat put her head in at one of the entrances, and called to him to
come out; but it was not till he had carefully peeped about, and thoroughly
satisfied himself that all was safe, that cunning Reynard ventured
to trust himself abroad.</p>

<p class='c000'>In great distress the stag related the cause of their coming. “I have
heard something of this matter before,” replied the fox; “but you are too
condescending to come and ask the advice of a simple creature like myself,
who never yet knew what policy or artifice meant, and—.” Here the cat and
the stag eagerly interrupted him, and with one voice began to compliment
him on the sagacity and wisdom for which all the world gave him credit,
declaring that their whole hope and consolation rested on his counsels.
“Well,” returned the fox, “since you will have it so, though I blush to
utter my poor thoughts before beasts so much my superiors, I will venture
with all humility to suggest, that a general meeting be immediately
summoned of all the animals of the forest, in order that we may take
our measures in concert, and after hearing the opinions of all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An excellent proposal!” cried the stag. “An excellent proposal!”
echoed the cat; “but who shall we send to call them all together?”—“I
would go to them myself,” replied the fox, “but it is possible that some
of the smaller animals might doubt the innocence of my intentions, and
refuse to come; for I have been a much calumniated creature. The same
thing might happen with you, neighbour Puss; the squirrel and the mouse
especially....” “True,” cried the cat, “they would, perhaps, be
taking some idle notions into their heads....” “And as to my lord
the stag,” rejoined Reynard, “he is a beast of far too exalted a rank for
such an office. Stay, there is my worthy friend the hedgehog, suppose
we send him; a little slow of foot, to be sure, and not wonderfully bright;
but a plain honest creature as any that lives, well spoken of throughout
the forest, and the enemy of no one, except indeed of the flies and the
beetles; but we do not call the insects to council, of course.”—“Of course,”
rejoined the cat; “but what shall we say to the reptiles?”—“Why, as to
my neighbour the viper,” returned the fox, “I own I am inclined to think
favourably of him, whatever some may whisper to his disadvantage; his
temper indeed may be none of the mildest, but he knows how to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>himself respected, and I think we must by no means leave him out; and
if he is admitted, in common civility his cousin the snake must be invited
also.”—“And what say you to the toad, the frog, and the newt?” asked
the stag. “Poor creatures,” said the fox with a sneer, “your lordship
is certainly very condescending to remember the existence of beings so
inferior. They sit in our council, truly! However, I would by no means
give offence, at a time like this, even to the meanest—they may be
permitted to hear the debate, provided they do not presume to speak
among their betters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fox now called in a somewhat imperious tone to the hedgehog to
come forth. At the sound of his voice, the little creature roused himself
with some difficulty from his morning’s nap, and hastily unrolling
himself and clearing his prickly coat from the grass and dead leaves that
stuck in it, and added not a little to his rude, slovenly appearance, he
crept out from his hole under the roots of a tree, and inquired with much
humility what Mr. Reynard wanted with him. The fox explained in few
words the alarming occurrence of the morning, and thus proceeded to give
the hedgehog his orders:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are to summon all our good neighbours to meet this evening, an
hour before sunset, under the great yew-tree that stands by itself near the
centre of the wood. Please to attend, and I will name them to you in
their order, that you may make no mistakes. First, you turn down into
yonder dingle, and there, just beyond the old poplar which is blown up by
the roots and lies across the way, look very sharp, and in a snug sheltered
nook you will spy a hole running down into the steep bank; at the bottom
of it you will find the badger. Beg him to come without fail; excepting
the present company there is no animal in the forest of greater size and
consequence, nor whom I respect more. A little lower down, on the very
brink of the stream, lives my cousin the polecat;—a damp situation, I
should think, but they say he sometimes amuses himself with fishing. He
is a sharp fellow; we must by all means have him at our council.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The weasel comes next, and you will find him in a hollow tree not
far off. If the squirrel be not frolicking as usual among the boughs of the
large beech in which he has his nest, nuts are now ripe, and you must
look for him in the hazel-copse on the left. If I do not mistake, you will
also find the dormouse lodged under the roots of that large oak hard by
which is so full of acorns; and the woodmouse is his next-door neighbour.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must then turn off toward the edge of the forest, and search
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>among the fern-brakes till you find the hare; she sits close in her form all
day. Assure her that we are extremely desirous of her company; and if
she, or any other of our good neighbours, should make the smallest scruple
of meeting puss or myself, be sure to mention that my lord the stag passes
his word for their safety, both coming and returning. The snake will
probably be sunning himself on the grass a little lower down; and in the
dry part of the wood above, if you look narrowly, you will spy the viper
lurking among the dead leaves. And now you may be gone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The hedgehog trudged off with his commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the evening every one of the animals made his appearance under the
yew-tree, except the little lazy dormouse, who had just opened his eyes
when the hedgehog delivered his message, then turned himself round,
fallen asleep again, and forgotten the whole matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>As undoubted lord of the forest, the stag took the upper place; puss
seated herself on his right, and Reynard on his left; the others placed
themselves in due order below. The stag opened the business of the day
by calling upon the cat to relate what she had that morning seen and
heard. Immediately, the afflicted creature yelled out her dismal tale,
ending with a long and melancholy mew which was echoed by every
animal present in his own note; the stag brayed, the fox howled, the
polecat and weasel cried, the badger and squirrel growled, the snake and
viper hissed, the hare screamed, and the mouse squeaked. When the
din of these discordant noises had a little subsided, “My friends,” said
the stag, “lamentations are in vain, let us now consider what is to be
done; shall we look on in tame submission to see our native wood levelled
with the earth, and ourselves turned out upon the wide world to seek for
food and shelter wherever we may find them, or shall we not rather all
join to defend it with such weapons as nature has given us? Let the
cat speak first.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am for open war,” cried puss; “these teeth and these talons were
not bestowed upon me for nothing;” (and as she spoke she unsheathed a
set of claws at sight of which the mouse and the squirrel trembled all
over.) “The first man who attacks my tree shall feel them in his eyes;
I will defend my native home as long as I have breath in my body. Who
is of the same mind?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Reynard, let us hear your opinion,” said the stag. “I beg to speak
last,” said the crafty fox; “perhaps I have not yet made up my opinion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For my part,” growled out the badger, thrusting forward his clumsy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>person as he spoke, “I am not so cunning as some folks; I speak my
mind and care for nobody; and I have only this to say—that I never
attack first, but I have strong teeth and a tough hide; and if anybody
attempts to turn me out of my den, whether man, dog, or any other beast,
I shall try to make him repent it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was observed that the badger, as he spoke, threw a sullen look at the
fox, which plainly showed that he had not forgotten the knavish trick by
which Reynard had once contrived to turn him out of a hole which he had
dug with the labours of his own claws, and to keep possession of it for
himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The viper now glided forward in easy curves, and coiling himself up,
and darting out his forked tongue in a threatening attitude, “Man,” said
he, “is my enemy, and I am his; let him set foot in my dominions if he
dares; I have a venom in my fangs which will soon teach him that my
anger is not to be despised.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I,” murmured out the snake, “have no venom to boast; I am an
innocent and defenceless creature, and I own that so far from attempting
to resist the invader, I shall quickly retreat from his approach. Nature,
in her bounty, has endued me with the power of swimming; and when I
can no longer find a shelter beneath these quiet shades, I shall plunge
into the stream which bounds our domain, and seek a safer retreat among
the tall weeds which flourish on its farther shore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As for me,” feebly screamed out the hare, as she limped forth, staring
around her with a look of affright, “all the world must be aware how
weak and timid a creature I am. It has been said that I have many
friends, but I have never yet found a protector, and cruel and powerful
enemies lie in wait for my harmless life on every side. What will
become of me I know not, probably some evil end awaits me; but I shall
use these nimble legs, my only hope of safety, to bear me far away from
the dreadful sight of man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The sprightly squirrel came forward with a bound. “I have teeth,”
cried he, “very able to crack a nut, and claws by which I can cling fast
enough to a bough, but how am I to contend against the mighty power of
man? He would twist off my poor little head before I could draw one
drop of blood from his finger. It is true that I can live only in trees,
and one might as well die fighting as pine away with misery and
hunger; but I have better things in view than either. From the summit
of my beech, I have often observed, at some distance on the farther side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of the river, a group of noble chestnuts growing in a park, which would
supply me both with food and lodging. I have also discovered a spot
where two trees on opposite sides of the stream stretch forth their arms,
and nearly meet above:—I have made up my mind to the adventure; one
bold leap will bear me safely, I hope, to the farther shore, and the new
and beautiful country that lies beyond it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe,” squeaked a small shrill voice which was found to proceed
from the mouse, “that my services would be of small importance in a
war against mankind; and I do not offer them. To say the truth, I find
myself, on second thoughts, not greatly concerned in this affair. If I lose
my nuts and acorns by the fall of the trees, I shall get wheat, barley, and
oats, in exchange, which are not worse eating, and I can lodge full as
well in the middle of a corn-rick as under the roots of a tree.—Every one
for himself in this world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our little friend is much in the right,” cried the weasel; “I really
believe that we shall find vastly comfortable lodging about barns and farmhouses,
and the very thought of a poultry-yard makes my mouth water:
for such an exchange I should not object to giving up my quarters in the
wood to-morrow.”—“Nor I, I protest,” exclaimed the polecat. “Hens’
eggs are not bad things, and how delicious to fatten on the blood of turkeys,
geese, and chickens! A forest is not absolutely necessary to me; I can
hide myself well enough in a hedge, or under a ditch-bank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Reynard,” said the stag, “all have spoken now but you, and we are
impatient for your opinion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The fox arose, cast his eyes on the ground with an air of great modesty,
and after pausing a few moments, as if to gain courage to speak, he thus
began, gracefully waving his long bushy tail as he spoke:—“While I
listened to the warlike eloquence of the cat, to the indignant harangue of
the viper, and to the resolute speech of my worthy friend, the badger, I.
like them, felt myself inspired with the valiant resolution to die in defence
of our native wood, and in open war with man. But when I afterward
began to consider the weakness of our lesser brethren, the smallness of
our numbers, and the wonderful power and resources of man, I was induced
to change my opinion. We cannot hope for victory, why should we throw
away our lives? The viper, in spite of his courage and his venom, would
be caught by the neck in a cleft stick, and put ingloriously to death very
likely before he had been able to inflict a single bite. The badger is a
favourite object of the cruelty of man; he would set upon him his whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>troop of dogs, hateful brutes, who are always joined in league with him
against their fellow beasts!—and though my worthy friend would fight
like a hero, and kill or maim several of them, he would at length be torn
in pieces. Of what avail would be the teeth and claws of the cat against
that thunder and lightning by which man has the art of killing from afar?
She would be brought down from her highest bough pierced through the
head or the heart, before she could even see that enemy whose eyes she
threatens to tear out with her talons. Even you yourself, my lord stag,
would assuredly fall by the teeth of those detestable hounds after you had
gored three or four of the pack. I therefore propose more cautious measures.
Not far off is a wide unfrequented common, where the badger may
dig himself a den and remain at peace, and where the viper may glide
undisturbed among the heath and gorse. I have scarcely given a thought
to the humble concerns of my insignificant self; but perhaps I too may
find some cover in that neglected tract, which abounds also in wild
rabbits. For you, my lord stag, you have only to swim the stream to find
yourself, like the squirrel, in a noble park where man himself would be
proud to become your protector, and own you for the noblest ornament
of his domain. And why should not puss offer her services to hunt the
mice and rats at some snug farmhouse in the neighbourhood?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I!” interrupted puss, setting up her back and swelling in sudden
anger, “I become a fawning menial in the dwellings of man, like those
miserable little foreigners who have sometimes appeared in my sight,
and whom I am ashamed to own for cats! No, I am a beast of prey, a
free native of the English woods, and such I will live and die. Man
may hunt me down, he may destroy my whole race, as he has already
hunted down and destroyed the bear and the wolf, animals much my
superiors in size and in strength; but I disdain to become his household
servant, or to skulk, like some of vermin breed, about his outhouses, and
poultry-yards, picking up a base living by theft and rapine. And you,
Reynard, crafty knave as you are, do you think I do not see through your
tricks and your pretences? You too, like the weasel and polecat, have
an eye on the poultry-yard and the sheepfold; you live by man though he
hates you, and endeavours to destroy you, and you care not what becomes
of the lives or liberty of nobler animals: but I will reach <em>your</em> eyes at
least, and teach you what it is to provoke me.” So saying, she flew at
him in a fury: her first attack brought him to the ground, and he was
almost blinded before he could strike a blow in his own defence. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>polecat and weasel, thinking their turns would come next, slunk away;
the hare and the smaller animals followed their example; even the stag
himself was seized with a panic and fled. The badger alone stood and
looked on with great composure at the distress of Reynard. At length,
the fox, seeing puss almost out of breath, made a desperate effort and
broke loose from her clutches. With his usual cunning he ran toward
the river, well knowing that the cat would not wet her feet. He plunged
into the water before she could overtake him, and swimming with some
difficulty to the opposite side, threw himself on the bank half dead with
pain and fright. Puss returned to her tree disappointed and sullen; and
thus unprofitably ended the Council of Quadrupeds.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ON WINE AND SPIRITS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>George and Harry, accompanied by their tutor, went one day to pay a
visit to a neighbouring gentleman, their father’s friend. They were very
kindly received, and shown all about the gardens and pleasure-grounds;
but nothing took their fancy so much as an extensive grapery, hung round
with bunches of various kinds fully ripe, and almost too big for the vines
to support. They were liberally treated with the fruit, and carried away
some bunches to eat as they walked. During their return, as they were
picking their grapes, George said to the tutor, “A thought is just come
into my head, sir. Wine, you know is called the juice of the grape; but
wine is hot, and intoxicates people that drink much of it. Now we have
had a good deal of grape-juice this morning, and yet I do not feel heated,
nor does it seem at all to have got into our heads. What is the reason of
this?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The reason is, that grape-juice is not wine, though wine is made
from it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Pray how is it made, then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I will tell you; for it is a matter worth knowing. The juice
pressed from the grapes, called <em>must</em>, is at first a sweet watery liquor,
with a little tartness, but with no strength or spirit. After it has stood
awhile, it begins to grow thick and muddy, it moves up and down, and
throws scum and bubbles of air to the surface. This is called <em>working</em>
or <em>fermenting</em>. It continues in this state for some time, more or less,
according to the quantity of the juice and the temperature of the weather,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and then gradually settles again, becoming clearer than at first. It has
now lost its sweet flat taste, and acquired a briskness and pungency, with
a heating and intoxicating property; that is, it has become <em>wine</em>. This
natural process is called the <em>vinous fermentation</em>, and many liquors besides
grape-juice are capable of undergoing it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have heard of the working of beer and ale. Is that of the same
kind?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is: and beer and ale may properly be called barley-wine; for
you know they are clear, brisk, and intoxicating. In the same manner,
cider is apple-wine, and mead is honey-wine; and you have heard of
raisin-wine and currant-wine, and a great many others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes, there is elder-wine, and cowslip-wine and orange-wine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Will everything of that sort make wine?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> All vegetable juices that are sweet are capable of fermenting, and
of producing a liquor of a vinous nature; but if they have little sweetness,
the liquor is proportionally weak and poor, and is apt to become sour or
vapid.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But barley is not sweet.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Barley as it comes from the ear is not; but before it is used for
brewing, it is made into <em>malt</em>, and then it is sensibly sweet. You know
what malt is?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I have seen heaps of it in the malt-house, but I do not know how
it is made.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Barley is made malt by putting it in heaps and wetting it, when
it becomes hot, and swells, and would sprout out just as if it were sown,
unless it were then dried in a kiln. By this operation it acquires a sweet
taste. You have drunk sweet-wort?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well, this is made by steeping malt in hot water. The water
extracts and dissolves all the sweet or sugary part of the malt. It then
becomes like a naturally sweet juice.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Would not sugar and water then make wine?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It would; and the wines made in England of our common fruits
and flowers have all a good deal of sugar in them. Cowslip flowers, for
example, give little more than the flavour to the wine named from them,
and it is the sugar added to them which properly makes the wine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But none of these wines are so good as grape-wine?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No. The grape, from the richness and abundance of its juice, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the fruit universally preferred for making wine, where it comes to perfection,
which it seldom does in our climate, except by means of artificial heat.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I suppose, then, grapes are finest in the hottest countries?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Not so, neither; they are properly a fruit of the temperate zone,
and do not grow well between the tropics. And in very hot countries it
is scarcely possible to make wines of any kind to keep, for they ferment so
strongly as to turn sour almost immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think I have read of palm-wine on the coast of Guinea.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. A sweet juice flows abundantly from incisions in certain
species of the palm; which ferments immediately, and makes a very
pleasant sort of weak wine. But it must be drunk the same day it is
made, for on the next it is as sour as vinegar.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What is vinegar—is it not sour wine?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Everything that makes wine will make vinegar also; and the
stronger the wine the stronger the vinegar. The vinous fermentation
must be first brought on, but it need not produce perfect wine, for when
the intention is to make vinegar, the liquor is kept still warm, and it goes
on without stopping to another kind of fermentation, called the <em>acetous</em>,
the product of which is vinegar.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have heard of alegar. I suppose that is vinegar made of ale.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is—but as ale is not so strong as wine, the vinegar made from
it is not so sharp or perfect. But housewives make good vinegar with
sugar and water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Will vinegar make people drunk if they take too much of it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No: the wine loses its intoxicating quality as well as its taste on
turning to vinegar.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What are spirituous liquors—have they not something to do with
wine?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes: they consist of the spirituous or intoxicating part of wine
separated from the rest. You may remember that, on talking of distillation,
I told you that it was the raising of a liquor in steam or vapour, and
condensing it again; and that some liquors were more easily turned to
vapour than others, and were therefore called more volatile or evaporable.
Now, wine is a mixed or compound liquor, of which the greater part is
water; but what heats and intoxicates is <em>vinous spirit</em>. This spirit being
much more volatile than water, on the application of a gentle heat, flies off
in vapour, and may be collected by itself in distilling vessels;—and thus
are made spirituous liquors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span><em>Geo.</em> Will everything that you called wine yield spirits?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes: everything that has undergone the vinous fermentation.
Thus, in England a great deal of malt spirit is made from a kind of wort
brought into fermentation, and then set directly to distil, without first
making ale or beer of it. Gin is a spirituous liquor also got from corn, and
flavoured with juniper berries. Even potatoes, carrots, and turnips, may
be made to afford spirits, by first fermenting their juices. In the West
Indies, rum is distilled from the dregs of the sugarcanes, washed out by
water and fermented. But brandy is distilled from the fermented juice of
the grape, and is made in the wine countries.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is spirit of wine different from spirituous liquors?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is the strongest part of them got by distilling over again; for all
these still contain a good deal of water, along with a pure spirit, which
may be separated by a gentler heat than was used at first. But in order
to procure this as strong and pure as possible, it must be distilled several
times over, always leaving some of the watery part behind. When perfectly
pure, it is the same, whatever spirituous liquor it is got from.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> My mamma has little bottles of lavender water. What is that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is a spirit of wine flavoured with lavender flowers; and it may in
like manner be flavoured with many other fragrant things, since their
odoriferous part is volatile, and will rise in vapour along with the spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Will not spirit of wine burn violently?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> That it will, I can tell you: and so will rum and brandy; for you
know it was set on fire when we made snap-dragon.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> All spirituous liquors are highly inflammable, and the more so the
purer they are. One way of trying the purity of spirit is to see if it will
burn all away without leaving any moisture behind. Then it is much
lighter than water, and that affords another way of judging of its strength.
A hollow ivory ball is set to swim in it; and the deeper it sinks down,
the lighter, and therefore the more spirituous, is the liquor.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have heard much of the mischief done by spirituous liquors—pray
what good do they do?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The use and abuse of wine and spirits is a very copious subject;
and there is scarcely any gift of human art, the general effects of which
are more dubious. You know what wine is said to be given for in the
Bible?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> To make glad the heart of man.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Right. And nothing has such an immediate effect in inspiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>vigour of body and mind as wine. It banishes sorrow and care, recruits
from fatigue, enlivens the fancy, inflames the courage, and performs a
hundred fine things, of which I could bring you abundant proof from the
poets. The physicians, too, speak almost as much in its favour, both in
diet and medicine. But its really good effects are only when used in
moderation; and it unfortunately is one of those things which man can
hardly be brought to use moderately. Excess in wine brings on effects
the very contrary to its benefits. It stupifies and enfeebles the mind, and
fills the body with incurable diseases. And this it does even when used
without intoxication. But a drunken man loses for the time every distinction
of a reasonable creature, and becomes worse than a brute beast.
On this account Mahomet entirely forbade its use to his followers, and to
this day it is not publicly drunk in any of the countries that receive the
Mohammedan religion.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Was not that right?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I think not. If we were entirely to renounce every thing that may
be misused, we should have scarce any enjoyments left; and it is a proper
exercise of our strength of mind to use good things with moderation, when
we have it in our power to do otherwise.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But spirituous liquors are not good at all, are they?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They have so little good and so much bad in them, that I confess I
wish their common use could be abolished altogether. They are generally
taken by the lowest class of people for the express purpose of intoxication;
and they are much sooner prejudicial to the health than wine, and, indeed,
when drunk unmixed, are no better than slow poison.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Spirit of wine is useful, though, for several things—is it not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; and I would have all spirits kept in the hands of chymists and
artists who know how to employ them usefully. Spirits of wine will
dissolve many things that water will not. Apothecaries use them in
drawing tinctures, and artists in preparing colours and making varnishes.
They are likewise very powerful preservatives from corruption. You may
have seen serpents and insects brought from abroad in vials full of spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And I know of another use of spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> What, is that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> To burn in lamps. My grandmamma has a teakettle with a lamp
under it to keep the water hot, and she burns spirits in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> So she does. Well—so much for the use of these liquors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span><em>Geo.</em> But you have said nothing about ale and beer. Are they wholesome?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, in moderation. But they are sadly abused too, and rob many
men of their health as well as their money and senses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Small beer does no harm, however.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No—and we will indulge in a good draught of it when we get
home.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I like water better.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Then drink it by all means. He that is satisfied with water has
one want the less, and may defy thirst, in this country, at least.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE BOY WITHOUT A GENIUS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>Mr. Wiseman, the schoolmaster, at the end of the summer-vacation,
received a new scholar with the following letter:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—This will be delivered to you by my son Samuel, whom I beg
leave to commit to your care, hoping that, by your well-known skill and
attention, you will be able to make something of him, which, I am sorry
to say, none of his masters have hitherto done. He is now eleven, and
yet can do nothing but read his mother-tongue, and that but indifferently.
We sent him, at seven, to a grammar-school in our neighbourhood; but his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>master soon found that his genius was not turned to learning languages.
He was then put to writing, but he set about it so awkwardly that he
made nothing of it. He was tried at accounts, but it appeared that he
had no genius for that either. He could do nothing in geography for
want of memory. In short, if he has any genius at all, it does not yet
show itself. But I trust to your experience in cases of this nature, to
discover what he is fit for, and to instruct him accordingly. I beg to be
favoured shortly with your opinion about him, and remain, sir,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your most obedient servant,</div>
      <div class='line in16'>“<span class='sc'>Humphrey Acres.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When Mr. Wiseman had read this letter, he shook his head, and said
to his assistant:—“A pretty subject they have sent us here! a lad that has
a great genius for nothing at all. But perhaps my friend Mr. Acres
expects that a boy should show a genius for a thing before he knows anything
about it—no uncommon error! Let us see, however, what the
youth looks like. I suppose he is a human creature, at least.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Master Samuel Acres was now called in. He came hanging down his
head, and looking as if he was going to be flogged.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come hither, my dear!” said Mr. Wiseman, “stand by me, and do not
be afraid. Nobody will hurt you. How old are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eleven, last May, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A well-grown boy of your age, indeed. You love play, I dare say?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What, are you a good hand at marbles?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pretty good, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And can spin a top, and drive a hoop, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then you have the full use of your hands and fingers?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can you write, Samuel?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I learned a little, sir, but I left it off again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And why so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because I could not make the letters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No! Why, how do you think other boys do—have they more fingers
than you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you not able to hold a pen as well as a marble?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Samuel was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me look at your hand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Samuel held out both his paws like a dancing bear.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see nothing to hinder you from writing as well as any boy in the
school. You can read, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tell me, then, what is written over the school-room door.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Samuel, with some hesitation, read:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“WHATEVER MAN HAS DONE, MAN MAY DO.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Pray, how did you learn to read?—Was it not by taking pains?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well—taking more pains will enable you to read better. Do you know
anything of the Latin grammar?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you never learned it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I tried, sir, but I could not get it by heart.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, you can say some things by heart. I dare say you can tell me
the names of the days of the week, in their order.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, I know them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the months in the year, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you could probably repeat the names of your brothers and sisters,
and all your father’s servants, and half the people in the village besides.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe I could, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well—and is <em>hic</em>, <em>hæc</em>, <em>hoc</em>, more difficult to remember than these?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Samuel was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you learned anything of accounts?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I went into addition, sir, but I did not go on with it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I could not do it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How many marbles can you buy for a penny?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Twelve new ones, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how many for two pence?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Twenty-four.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how many for a half-penny?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Six.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“If you were to have a penny a day, what would that make in a week?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Seven pence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But if you paid two pence out of that, what would you have left?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Samuel studied a while, and then said, “Five pence.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Right. Why, here you have been practising the four great rules of
arithmetic—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division! Learning
accounts is no more than this. Well, Samuel, I shall see what you are
fit for. I shall set you about nothing but what you are able to do; but,
observe, you must do it. We have no <em>I can’t</em> here. Now go among
your schoolfellows.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Samuel went away, glad that his examination was over, and with more
confidence in his powers than he had felt before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day he began business. A boy less than himself was called
out to set him a copy of letters, and another was appointed to hear him in
grammar. He read a few sentences in English that he could perfectly
understand to the master himself. Thus, by going on steadily and slowly,
he made a sensible progress. He had already joined his letters, got all
the declensions perfectly, and half the multiplication table, when Mr.
Wiseman thought it time to answer his father’s letter; which he did as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>, I now think it right to give you some information concerning your
son. You perhaps expected it sooner, but I always wish to avoid hasty
judgments. You mentioned in your letter that it had not yet been
discovered which way his genius pointed. If by <em>genius</em> you meant such
a decided bent of mind to any one pursuit as will lead to excel with little
or no labour or instruction, I must say that I have not met with such a
quality in more than three or four boys in my life, and your son is certainly
not among the number. But if you mean only the <em>ability</em> to do some of
those things which the greater part of mankind can do when properly
taught, I can affirm that I find in him no peculiar deficiency. And whether
you choose to bring him up to trade, or to some practical profession, I see
no reason to doubt that he may in time become sufficiently qualified for
it. It is my favourite maxim, sir, that everything most valuable in this
life may generally be acquired by taking pains for it. Your son has
already lost much time in the fruitless expectation of finding out what he
would take up of his own accord. Believe me, sir, few boys will take up
anything of their own accord but a top or a marble. I will take care,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>while he is with me, that he loses no more time this way, but is employed
about things that are fit for him, not doubting that we shall find him fit
for them.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>HALF A CROWN’S WORTH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Valentine was in his thirteenth year, and a scholar in one of our great
schools. He was a well-disposed boy, but could not help envying a little,
some of his companions, who had a larger allowance of money than
himself. He ventured in a letter to sound his father on the subject, not
directly asking for a particular sum, but mentioning that many of the
boys in his class had half a crown a week for pocket-money.</p>

<p class='c000'>His father, who did not choose to comply with his wishes for various
reasons, nor yet to refuse him in a mortifying manner, wrote an answer,
the chief purpose of which was to make him sensible what sort of a sum
half a crown a week was, and to how many more important uses it might
be put, than to provide a school-boy with things absolutely superfluous to
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is calculated,” said he, “that a grown man may be kept in health
and fit for labour upon a pound and a half of good bread a day. Suppose
the value of this to be two pence half-penny, and add a penny for a quart
of milk, which will greatly improve his diet, half a crown will keep him
eight or nine days in this manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A common labourer’s wages in our country are seven shillings per
week, and if you add somewhat extraordinary for harvest work, this will
not make it amount to three half-crowns on an average the year round.
Suppose his wife and children to earn another half-crown. For this ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>shillings per week he will maintain himself, his wife, and half a dozen
children, in food, lodging, clothes, and fuel. A half-crown then may be
reckoned the full weekly maintenance of two human creatures in every
thing necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where potatoes are much cultivated, two bushels, weighing eighty
pounds a piece, may be purchased for half a crown. Here are one hundred
and sixty pounds of solid food, of which allowing for the waste in
dressing, you may reckon two pounds and a half sufficient for the sole
daily nourishment of one person. At this rate, nine people might be fed
a week for half a crown; poorly, indeed, but so as many thousands are
fed, with the addition of a little salt or buttermilk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the father of a numerous family were out of work, or the mother
lying-in, a parish would think half a crown a week a very ample assistance
to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many of the cottagers round us would receive with great thankfulness
a sixpenny loaf per week, and reckon it a very material addition to their
children’s bread. For half a crown, therefore, you might purchase—the
weekly blessings of five poor families.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Porter is a sort of luxury to a poor man, but not a useless one, since
it will stand in the place of some solid food, and enable him to work with
better heart. You could treat a hard-working man with a pint a day of
this liquor for twelve days, with half a crown.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Many a cottage in the country inhabited by a large family is let for
forty shillings a year. Half a crown a week would pay the full rent of
three such cottages, and allow somewhat over for repairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The usual price for schooling at a dame-school in a village is two
pence a week. You might, therefore, get fifteen children instructed in
reading, and the girls in sewing, for half a crown weekly. But even in
a town you might get them taught reading, writing, and accounts, and so
fitted for any common trade, for five shillings a quarter; and therefore
half a crown a week would keep six children at such a school, and provide
them with books besides.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All these are ways in which half a crown a week might be made to
do a great deal of good to <em>others</em>. I shall now just mention one or two
ways of laying it out with advantage to yourself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know you are very fond of coloured plates of plants, and other objects
of natural history. There are now several works of this sort publishing
in monthly numbers, as the Botanical Magazine, the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Botany, the Flora Rustica, and the Naturalist’s Magazine. Now half a
crown a week would reach the purchase of the best of these.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The same sum laid out in the old book-shops in London would buy
you more classics, and pretty editions too, in one year, than you could
read in five.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now I do not grudge laying out half a crown a week upon you; but
when so many good things for yourself and others may be done with it,
I am unwilling you should squander it away like your schoolfellows, in
tarts and trinkets.”</p>

    <div><em>Of a Complaint made against Sundry Persons for breaking the Windows of</em> <span class='sc'>Dorothy Careful</span>, <em>Widow and Dealer in Gingerbread.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The court being seated, there appeared in person the widow <em>Dorothy
Careful</em>, to make a complaint against <em>Henry Luckless</em>, and other person
or persons unknown, for breaking three panes of glass, value ninepence,
in the house of the said widow. Being directed to tell her case to the
court, she made a courtesy, and began as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Please your lordship, I was sitting at work by my fireside, between
the hours of six and seven in the evening, just as it was growing dusk,
and little Jack was spinning beside me, when all at once crack went the
window, and down fell a little basket of cakes that was set up against it.
I started up, and cried to Jack, ‘Bless me, what’s the matter?’ So, says
Jack, ‘Somebody has thrown a stone and broke the window, and I dare
say it is some of the schoolboys.’ With that I ran out of the house, and
saw some boys making off as fast as they could go. So I ran after them
as quick as my old legs would carry me; but I should never have come
near them, if one had not happened to fall down. Him I caught and
brought back to my house, when Jack knew him at once to be Master
Harry Luckless. So I told him I would complain of him the next day;
and I hope your worship will make him pay the damage, and I think he
deserves a good whipping into the bargain, for injuring a poor widow
woman.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This was meant as a sequel of that very pleasing and ingenious little work,
entitled <cite>Juvenile Trials</cite>, in which a Court of Justice is supposed to be instituted in a
boarding-school, composed of the scholars themselves, for the purpose of trying
offences committed at school.</p>
</div>
<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The judge having heard Mrs. Careful’s story, desired her to sit down;
and then calling up Master Luckless, asked him what he had to say for
himself. Luckless appeared with his face a good deal scratched, and
looking very ruefully. After making his bow, and sobbing two or three
times, he said:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“My lord, I am as innocent of this matter as any boy in the school,
and I am sure I have suffered enough about it already. My lord, Billy
Thompson and I were playing in the lane near Mrs. Careful’s house,
when we heard the window crash; and directly after she came running
out toward us. Upon this, Billy ran away, and I ran too, thinking I
might bear the blame. But after running a little way, I stumbled over
something that lay in the road, and before I could get up again she overtook
me, and caught me by the hair, and began lugging and cuffing me.
I told her it was not I that broke her window, but it did not signify; so she
dragged me to the light, lugging and scratching me all the while, and then
said she would inform against me; and that is all I know of the matter.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Judge.</em> I find, good woman, you were willing to revenge yourself,
without waiting for the justice of this court.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Widow Careful.</em> My lord, I confess I was put into a passion, and did
not properly consider what I was doing.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> Well, where is Billy Thompson?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Billy.</em> Here, my lord.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> You have heard what Harry Luckless says. Declare upon your
honour whether he has spoken the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bil.</em> My lord, I am sure neither he nor I had any concern in breaking
the window. We were standing together at the time, and I ran on hearing
the door open, for fear of being charged with it, and he followed. But
what became of him I did not stay to see.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> So you let your friend shift for himself, and only thought of
saving yourself. But did you see any other person about the house or in
the lane?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bil.</em> My lord, I thought I heard somebody on the other side of the
hedge, creeping along, a little before the window was broken, but I saw
nobody.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> You hear, good woman, what is alleged in behalf of the person
you have accused. Have you any other evidence against him?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Wid.</em> One might be sure that they would deny it, and tell lies for one
another; but I hope I am not to be put off in that manner.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span><em>Jud.</em> I must tell you, mistress, that you give too much liberty to your
tongue, and are guilty of as much injustice as that of which you complain,
I should be sorry, indeed, if the young gentlemen of this school deserved
the general character of liars. You will find among us, I hope, as just a
sense of what is right and honourable, as among those who are older;
and our worthy master certainly would not permit us to try offences in
this manner, if he thought us capable of bearing false witness in each
other’s favour.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Wid.</em> I ask your lordship’s pardon, I did not mean to offend: but it is
a heavy loss for a poor woman, and though I did not catch the boy in the
fact, he was the nearest when it was done.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> As this is no more than a suspicion, and he has the positive evidence
of his schoolfellow in his favour, it will be impossible to convict
him, consistently with the rules of justice. Have you discovered any
other circumstance that may point out the offender?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Wid.</em> My lord, next morning Jack found on the floor this top, which I
suppose the window was broken with.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> Hand it up—here, gentlemen of the jury, please to examine it, and
see if you can discover anything of its owner.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Juryman.</em> Here is P. R. cut upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Another.</em> Yes, and I am sure I remember Peter Riot’s having just such
a one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Another.</em> So do I.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> Master Riot, is this your top?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Riot.</em> I don’t know, my lord, perhaps it may be mine; I have had a
great many tops, and when I have done with them, I throw them away,
and anybody may pick them up that pleases. You see it has lost its peg.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> Very well, sir. Mrs. Careful, you may retire.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Wid.</em> And must I have no amends, my lord?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jud.</em> Have patience. Leave everything to the court. We shall do
you all the justice in our power.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the widow was gone, the judge rose from his seat, and with
much solemnity thus addressed the assembly:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gentlemen,—this business, I confess, gives me much dissatisfaction.
A poor woman has been insulted and injured in her property, apparently
without provocation; and though she has not been able to convict the
offender, it cannot be doubted that she, as well as the world in general,
will impute the crime to some of our society. Though I am in my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>mind convinced that in her passion she charged an innocent person, yet
the circumstance of the top is a strong suspicion, indeed almost a proof,
that the perpetrator of this unmanly mischief was one of our body. The
owner of the top has justly observed, that its having been his property is
no certain proof against him. Since, therefore, in the present defect of
evidence, the whole school must remain burdened with the discredit of
this action, and share in the guilt of it, I think fit, in the first place, to
decree, that restitution shall be made to the sufferer out of the public
chest; and next that a court of inquiry be instituted for the express purpose
of searching thoroughly into this affair, with power to examine all
persons upon honour who are thought likely to be able to throw light
upon it. I hope, gentlemen, these measures meet with your concurrence?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole court bowed to the judge, and expressed their entire satisfaction
with his determination.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was then ordered that the public treasurer should go to the Widow
Careful’s house, any pay her the sum of one shilling, making at the same
time a handsome apology in the name of the school. And six persons
were taken by lot out of the jury to compose the court of inquiry, which
was to sit in the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>The court then adjourned.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the meeting of the court of inquiry, the first thing proposed by the
president, was, that the persons who usually played with Master Riot
should be sent for. Accordingly Tom Frisk and Bob Loiter were summoned,
when the president asked them upon their honour if they knew
the top to have been Riot’s. They said they did. They were then asked
whether they remembered when Riot had it in his possession?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Frisk.</em> He had it the day before yesterday, and split a top of mine
with it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Loiter.</em> Yes, and then, as he was making a stroke at mine, the peg
flew out.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>President.</em> What did he then do with it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> He put it into his pocket, and said, as it was a strong top, he would
have it mended.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> Then he did not throw it away, or give it to any body?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Loit.</em> No; he pocketed it up, and we saw no more of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> Do you know of any quarrel he had with Widow Careful?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> Yes; a day or two before, he went to her shop for some ginger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>bread; but, as he already owed her sixpence, she would not let him have
any till he had paid his debts.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> How did he take the disappointment?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> He said he would be revenged on her.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> Are you sure he used such words?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fr.</em> Yes; Loiter heard him as well as myself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Loit.</em> I did, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> Do either of you know any more of this affair?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Both.</em> No, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> You may go.</p>

<p class='c000'>The President now observed that these witnesses had done a great deal
in establishing proofs against Riot; for it was now pretty certain that no
one but himself could have been in possession of the top at the time the
crime was committed; and also it appeared that he had declared a malicious
intention against the woman, which it was highly probable he would
put into execution.—As the court were debating about the next step to be
taken, they were acquainted that Jack, the widow’s son, was waiting at
the school-door for admission; and a person being sent out for him, Riot
was found threatening the boy, and bidding him go home about his business.
The boy, however, was conveyed safely into the room, when he
thus addressed himself to the president:—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jack.</em> Sir, and please your worship, as I was looking about this
morning for sticks in the hedge over against our house, I found this buckle.
So I thought to myself, sure this must belong to the rascal that broke our
windows. So I have brought it to see if anybody in the school would
own it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> On which side of the hedge did you find it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jack.</em> On the other side from our house, in the close.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> Let us see it. Gentlemen, this is so smart a buckle, that I am
sure I remember it at once, and so I dare say you all do.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Al</em>l. It is Riot’s.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> Has anybody observed Riot’s shoes to-day?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>One Boy.</em> Yes, he has got them tied with strings.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pres.</em> Very well, gentlemen; we have nothing more to do than to draw
up an account of all the evidence we have heard, and lay it before his
lordship. Jack, you may go home.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jack.</em> Pray, sir, let somebody go with me, for I am afraid of Riot, who
has just been threatening me at the door.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span><em>Pres.</em> Master Bold will please to go along with the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The minutes of the court were then drawn up, and the President took
them to the judge’s chamber. After the judge had perused them, he
ordered an endictment to be drawn up against Peter Riot, “for that he
meanly, clandestinely, and with malice aforethought, had broken three
panes in the window of Widow Careful, with a certain instrument called
a top, whereby he had committed an atrocious injury on an innocent
person, and had brought a disgrace upon the society to which he belonged.”
At the same time, he sent an officer to inform Master Riot that his trial
would come on next morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Riot, who was with some of his gay companions, affected to treat the
matter with great indifference, and even to make a jest of it. However,
in the morning he thought it best to endeavour to make it up; and
accordingly, when the court was assembled, he sent one of his friends
with a shilling, saying that he would not trouble them with any further
inquiries, but would pay the sum that had been issued out of the public
stock. On the receipt of this message the Judge rose with much severity
in his countenance; and observing, that by such a contemptuous behaviour
towards the court the criminal had greatly added to his offence, he ordered
two officers with their staves immediately to go and bring in Riot, and to
use force if he should resist them. The culprit, thinking it best to submit,
was presently led in between the two officers; when, being placed at the
bar, the judge thus addressed him:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sorry, sir, that any member of this society can be so little sensible
of the nature of a crime, and so little acquainted with the principles of
a court of justice, as you have shown yourself to be, by the proposal you
took the improper liberty of sending to us. If you meant it as a confession
of your guilt, you certainly ought to have waited to receive from us the
penalty we thought proper to inflict, and not to have imagined that an
offer of the mere payment of damages would satisfy the claims of justice
against you. If you had only broken the window by accident, and of
your own accord offered restitution, nothing less than the full damages
could have been accepted. But you now stand charged with having done
this mischief, meanly, secretly, and maliciously, and thereby have added
a great deal of criminal intention to the act. Can you then think that a
court like this, designed to watch over the morals, as well as protect the
properties of our community, can so slightly pass over such aggravated
offences? You can claim no merit from confessing the crime, now that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>you know so much evidence will appear against you. And if you choose
still to plead not guilty, you are at liberty to do it, and we will proceed
immediately to the trial, without taking any advantage of the confession
implied by your offer of payment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Riot stood silent for some time, and then begged to be allowed to consult
with his friends what was best for him to do. This was agreed to,
and he was permitted to retire, though under guard of an officer. After
a short absence, he returned with more humility in his looks, and said
that he pleaded guilty, and threw himself on the mercy of the court. The
judge then made a speech of some length, for the purpose of convincing
the prisoner as well as the bystanders of the enormity of the crime. He
then pronounced the following sentence:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“You, Peter Riot, are hereby sentenced to pay the sum of half a crown
to the public treasury, as a satisfaction for the mischief you have done,
and your attempt to conceal it. You are to repair to the house of Widow
Careful, accompanied by such witnesses as we shall appoint, and there
having first paid her the sum you owe her, you shall ask her pardon for
the insult you offered her. You shall likewise, to-morrow, after school,
stand up in your place, and before all the scholars ask pardon for the
disgrace you have been the means of bringing upon the society; and in
particular you shall apologise to Master Luckless, for the disagreeable
circumstance you were the means of bringing him into. Till all this is
complied with, you shall not presume to come into the play-ground, or
join in any of the diversions of the school; and all persons are hereby
admonished not to keep your company till this is done.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Riot was then dismissed to his room; and in the afternoon he was
taken to the widow’s, who was pleased to receive his submission
graciously, and at the same time to apologise for her own improper treatment
of Master Luckless, to whom she sent a present of a nice ball by
way of amends.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus ended this important business.</p>

<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">papilio</span></i>, the Latin word for a butterfly, which insect they are thought to
resemble.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> The pea does a little, but not much.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Some do much more than these. Well—you see first a broad
leaf standing upright, but somewhat bent back; this is named the
<em>standard</em>. On each side are two narrower, called the <em>wings</em>. The under
side of the flower is formed of a hollow part resembling a boat: this is
called a <em>keel</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> It is very like a boat indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> In some kinds, however, it is divided in the middle, and so is like
a boat split in two. All these parts have claws which unite to form a
tube, set in a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">calyx</span></i>, or flower-cup. This tube, you observe, is longer in
the bean than in the pea, and the proportions of the other parts are somewhat
different; but the parts themselves are found in both.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> So they are. I think them alike now.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is the consequence of examining closely. Now let us strip
off all the leaves of this bean-flower but the keel. What do you think this
boat contains?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> It must be those little things you told us are in all flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> The chives and pistil.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Right. I will draw down the keel gently, and you shall see them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span><em>Har.</em> How curious!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Here are a number of chives joining in their bodies, so as to make
a round tube, or cylinder, through which comes out a crooked thread,
which is the pistil. I will now with a pin slit this cylinder. What do
you see within it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Somewhat like a little pod.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True—and to show you that it is a pod, I will open it, and you
shall see the seeds within it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What tiny things! Is this, then, what makes the bean-pod
afterward?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is. When the blossom drops, this seed-vessel grows bigger and
bigger, and at length hardens as the seeds grow ripe, becomes black and
shrivelled, and would burst and shed the seeds, if they were not gathered.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have seen several burst pods of our sweet-peas under the wall,
with nothing left in them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> And it is common for the field peas and beans to lose a great part
of the seeds while they are getting in.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> At the bottom of this pea-stalk there are some pods set already.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Open one. You see that the pod is composed of two shells, and
that all the seeds are fastened to one side of the pod, but alternately to
each shell.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is it the same in beans?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, and in all other pods of the papilionaceous flowers. Well—this
is the general structure of a very numerous and useful class of plants,
called the <em>leguminous</em> or <em>podded</em>. Of these, in this country, the greater
part are herbaceous, with some shrubs. In the warm climates there are
also tall trees. Many of the leguminous plants afford excellent nourishment
for man and beast; and their pods have the name of <em>pulse</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have read of persons living on pulse, but I did not know what it
meant before.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is frequently mentioned as part of the diet of abstemious persons.
Of this kind, we eat peas, beans, and kidney or French beans, of all which
there are a variety of sorts cultivated. Other nations eat lentils and
lupines, which are of this class; with several others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I remember our lupines in the garden have flowers of this kind,
with pods growing in clusters. We only cultivate them for the colour
and smell.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> But other nations eat them. Then, all the kinds of clover, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>trefoil, which are so useful in feeding cattle, belong to this tribe; as do
likewise vetches, sanfoin, and lucerne, which are used for the same
purpose. These principally compose what are usually, though improperly,
called, in agriculture, <em>artificial grasses</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Clover flowers are as sweet as beans; but do they bear pods?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; very short ones, with one or two seeds in each. But there
is a kind called nonsuch, with a very small yellow flower, that has a
curious twisted pod like a snail-shell. Many of the leguminous plants
are weak, and cannot support themselves; hence they are furnished with
tendrils, by means of which they clasp neighbouring plants, and run up
them. You know the garden-peas do so on the sticks which are set in
the rows with them. Some kind of vetches run in this manner up the
hedges, which they decorate with their long bunches of blue or purple
flowers. Tares, which are some of the slenderest of the family, do much
mischief among corn by twining round it and choking it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What are they good for, then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are weeds or noxious plants with respect to us; but doubtless
they have their uses in the creation. Some of our papilionaceous
plants, however, are able enough to shift for themselves; for gorse or furze
is of the number.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What, that prickly bush all covered over with yellow flowers, that
overruns our common?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Then there is broom, a plant as big, but without thorns, and with
larger flowers. This is as frequent as furze in some places.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I know it grows in abundance in the broom-field.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It does; but the naming of fields and places from it is a proof
that it is not so common as the other.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> We have some bushes of white broom in the shrubbery, and
some trees of Spanish broom.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. You have also a small tree which flowers early, and bears
a great many pendent branches of yellow blossoms, that look peculiarly
beautiful when intermixed with the purple lilacs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I know it—laburnum.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Right. This is one of our class of plants too. Then there is a
large tree, with delicate little leaves, protected by long thorns, and bearing
bunches of white papilionaceous flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I know which you mean, but I cannot tell the name.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is the bastard-acacia, or locust-tree, a native of America. Thus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>you see, we have traced this class of plants through all sizes, from the
trefoil that covers the turf, to a large tree. I should not, however, forget
two others, the licorice, and the tamarind. The licorice, with the sweet
root of which you are well acquainted, grows in the warmer countries,
especially Spain, but is cultivated in some parts of England, especially
at Pomfret, in Yorkshire. The tamarind is a large spreading tree growing
in the West Indies, and valued for its shade, as well as for the cooling
acid pulp of its pods, which are preserved with sugar and sent over to us.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I know them very well.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well—do you think now you shall both be able to discover a
papilionaceous flower when you meet with it again?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I believe I shall, if they are all like these we have been examining.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They have all the same parts, though variously proportioned.
What are these?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> There is the standard and two wings.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And the keel.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Right—the keel sometimes cleft into two, and then it is an irregular
five-leaved flower. The chives are generally ten, of which one
stands apart from the rest. The pistil single, and ending in a pod.
Another circumstance common to most of this tribe, is, that their leaves
are <em>winged</em>, or <em>pinnated</em>, that is, having leaflets set opposite each other,
upon a middle rib. You see this structure in these bean-leaves. But in
the clovers there are only two opposite leaflets, and one terminating;
whence their name of trefoil, or three-leaf. What we call a club on cards
is properly a clover-leaf, and the French call it <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trefle</span></i>, which means the
same.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think this tribe of plants almost as useful as the grasses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They perhaps come the next in utility: but their seeds, such as
beans and peas, are not quite such good nourishment as corn, and bread
cannot be made of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But clover is better than grass for cattle.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is more fattening, and makes cows yield plenty of fine milk.
Well—let us march.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>ON MAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Charles.</em> You gave me the definition of a horse some time ago—Pray,
sir, how is a man defined?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span><em>Father.</em> That is worth inquiring. Let us consider then. He must
either stand by himself, or be ranked among the quadrupeds; for there
are no other two-legged animals but birds, which he certainly does not
resemble.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But how can he be made a quadruped?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> By setting him to crawl on the ground, in which case he will as
much resemble a baboon as a baboon set on his hind-legs does a man. In
reality, there is little difference between the arms of a man and the fore-legs
of a quadruped; and in all other circumstances of internal and
external structure, they are evidently formed upon the same model.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I suppose then we must call him a digitated quadruped, that
generally goes upon its hind legs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> A naturalist could not reckon him otherwise; and, accordingly,
Linnæus has placed him in the same division with apes, macocos, and bats.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Apes, macocos, and bats!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yes—they have all four cutting teeth in the upper jaw, and teats
on the breast. How do your like your relations?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Not at all!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Then we will get rid of them by applying to the other part of
human nature—the <em>mind</em>. Man is an animal possessed of <em>reason</em>, and
the only one. This, therefore, is enough to define him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I have often heard that man is a rational creature, and I have a
notion what that means; but I should like to have an exact definition of
reason.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Reason is the faculty by which we compare ideas, and draw
conclusions. A man walking in the woods of an unknown country finds
a bow. He compares it in his mind with other bows, and forms the
conclusion that it must have been made by man, and that therefore the
country is probably inhabited. He discovers a hut; sees in it half-burnt
wood, and finds that the ashes are not quite cold. He concludes, therefore,
with certainty, not only that there are inhabitants, but that they cannot be
far distant. No other animal could do this.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But would not a dog who had been used to live with men run into
such a hut and expect to find people in it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> He probably would—and this, I acknowledge, is very like reason;
for he may be supposed to compare in his mind the hut he has lived in
with that he sees, and to conclude that as there were men in the first there
are in the last. But how little a way does this carry him? He finds no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>men there, and he is unable by any marks to form any judgment how long
they have been absent, or what sort of people they were; still less does
he form any plan of conduct in consequence of his discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Then is not the difference only that man has much reason, and
brutes little?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> If we adhere to the mere words of the definition of reason, I believe
this must be admitted; but in the exercise of it, the superiority of the
human faculties is so great, that man is in many points absolutely
distinguished from brutes. In the first place he has the <em>use of speech</em>,
which no other animal has attained.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Cannot many animals make themselves understood by one another
by their cries?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> They can make known a few of their common wants and desires,
but they cannot <em>discourse</em>, or communicate ideas stored up in the memory.
It is this faculty which makes man an <em>improvable</em> being, the wisdom
and experience acquired by one individual being thus transmitted to others,
and so on in an endless series of progression.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no reason to suppose that the dogs of the present day are more
knowing than those which lived a thousand years ago; but the men of this
age are much better acquainted with numberless arts and sciences than
their remote ancestors; since, by the use of speech and of writing (which
is speech addressed to the eye), every age adds its own discoveries to all
former ones. This knowledge of the past likewise gives man a great
insight into the future. Shakspeare excellently defines man by saying that
he is a creature “made with large discourse, looking before and after.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Animals must surely know something of the future, when they lay
up a store of provisions for the winter.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No—it is pretty certain that this is not the case, for they will do it
as much the first year of their lives as any other. Young bees turned out
of their hive, as soon as they have swarmed and got a habitation, begin
laying up honey, though they cannot possibly foresee the use they shall
have for it. There are a vast number of actions of this kind in animals
which are directed to a useful end, but an end which the animal knows
nothing of. And this is what we call <em>instinct</em>, and properly distinguish
from reason. Man has less of it than almost any other animal, because
he wants it less. Another point of essential difference is, that man is the
only animal that makes use of <em>instruments</em> in any of his actions. He is a
<em>tool-making</em> and <em>machine-making</em> animal. By means of this faculty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>alone he is every where lord of the creation, and has equally triumphed
over the subtlety of the cunning, the swiftness of the fleet, and the force
of the strong. He is the only animal that has found out the use of <em>fire</em>, a
most important acquisition!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I have read of some large apes that will come and sit round a fire
in the woods when men have left it, but have not the sense to keep it in,
by throwing on sticks.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Still less then could they light a fire. In consequence of this
discovery man cooks his food, which no other animal does. He alone
fences against the cold by clothing as well as by fire. He alone cultivates
the earth, and keeps living animals for future uses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But have not there been wild men bred in the woods that could do
none of these things?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Some instances of this kind are recorded, and they are not to be
wondered at; for man was meant to be a <em>gregarious</em> animal, or one living
in society, in which alone his faculties have full scope, and especially his
power of improving by the use of speech. These poor solitary creatures,
brought up with the brutes, were in a state entirely unnatural to them. A
solitary bee, ant, or beaver, would have none of the skill and sagacity of
those animals in their proper social condition. Society sharpens all the
faculties, and gives ideas and views which never could have been entertained
by an individual.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But some men that live in society seem to be little above the
brutes, at least when compared with other men. What is a Hottentot in
comparison with one of us?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> The difference, indeed, is great; but we agree in the most essential
characters of <em>man</em>, and perhaps the advantage is not all on our side. The
Hottentot cultivates the earth and rears cattle. He not only herds with
his fellows, but he has instituted some sort of government for the protection
of the weak against the strong; he has a notion of right and wrong,
and is sensible of the necessity of controlling present appetites and passions
for the sake of a future good. He has therefore <em>morals</em>. He is possessed
of weapons, tools, clothing, and furniture of his own making. In agility
of body, and the knowledge of various circumstances relative to the nature
of animals, he surpasses us. His inferiority lies in those things in which
many of the lowest class among us are equally inferior to the instructed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But Hottentots have no notion of a God or a future state.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> I am not certain how far that is fact: but alas! how many among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>us have no knowledge at all on these subjects, or only some vague notions
full of absurdity and superstition! People far advanced in civilization have
held the grossest errors on these subjects, which are only to be corrected
by the serious application of reason, or by a direct revelation from Heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> You said man was an <em>improveable</em> creature—but have not many
nations been a long time in a savage state without improvement?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Man is always <em>capable of improvement</em>; but he may exist a long
time, in society, without <em>actually improving</em> beyond a certain point.
There is little improvement among nations who have not the art of
<em>writing</em>, for tradition is not capable of preserving very accurate or extensive
knowledge; and many arts and sciences, after flourishing greatly, have
been entirely lost, in countries which have been overrun by barbarous
and illiterate nations. Then there is a principle which I might have
mentioned as one of those that distinguish man from brutes, but it as
much distinguishes some men from others. This is <em>curiosity</em>, or the love
of knowledge for its own sake. Most savages have little or nothing of
this; but without it we should want one of the chief inducements to exert
our faculties. It is curiosity that impels us to search into the properties
of every part of nature, to try all sorts of experiments, to visit distant
regions, and even to examine the appearances and motions of the heavenly
bodies. Every fact thus discovered leads to other facts; and there is no
limit to be set to this progress. The time may come, when what we now
know may seem as much ignorance to future ages as the knowledge of
early times does to us.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> What nations know the most at present?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> The Europeans have long been distinguished for superior ardour
after knowledge, and they possess beyond comparison the greatest share
of it, whereby they have been enabled to command the rest of the world.
The countries in which the arts and sciences most flourish at present are
the northern and middle parts of Europe, and also North America, which,
is inhabited by descendants of Europeans. In these countries man may be
said to be <em>most man</em>; and they may apply to themselves the poet’s boast:—</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>WALKING THE STREETS.—<span class='sc'>A Parable.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Have you ever walked through the crowded streets of a great city?</p>

<p class='c000'>What shoals of people pouring in from opposite quarters, like torrents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>meeting in a narrow valley! You would imagine it impossible for them
to get through; yet all pass on their way without stop or molestation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Were each man to proceed exactly in the line in which he set out, he
could not move many paces without encountering another full in his track.
They would strike against each other, fall back, push forward again, block
up the way for themselves and those after them, and throw the whole
street into confusion. All this is avoided by every man’s <em>yielding a little</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instead of advancing square, stiff, with arms stuck out, every one who
knows how to walk the streets glides along, his arms close, his body
oblique and flexible, his track gently winding, leaving now a few inches
on this side, now on that, so as to pass and be passed without touching,
in the smallest possible space.</p>

<p class='c000'>He pushes no one into the kennel, nor goes into it himself. By
<em>mutual accommodation</em>, the path, though narrow, holds them all.</p>

<p class='c000'>He goes neither much faster nor much slower than those who go in the
same direction. In the first case he would elbow, in the second he would
be elbowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any accidental stop arises, from a carriage crossing, a cask rolled, a
pickpocket detected, or the like, he does not increase the bustle by rushing
into the midst of it, but checks his pace, and patiently waits for its removal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like this is the <em>march of life</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In our progress through the world a thousand things stand continually
in our way. Some people meet us full in the face with opposite opinions
and inclinations. Some stand before us in our pursuit of pleasure or
interest, and others follow close upon our heels. Now, we ought in the
first place to consider, that the <em>road is as free for one as another</em>; and
therefore we have no right to expect that persons should go out of their
way to let us pass, any more than we out of ours. Then, if we do not
mutually yield and accommodate a little, it is clear that we must all stand
still, or be thrown into a perpetual confusion of squeezing and jostling.
If we are all in a hurry to get on as fast as possible to some point of
pleasure or interest in our view, and do not occasionally hold back, when
the crowd gathers, and angry contentions arise, we shall only augment
the tumult, without advancing our own progress. On the whole, it is our
business to move onward, steadily, but quietly, obstructing others as little
as possible, yielding a little to this man’s prejudices, and that man’s desires,
and doing everything in our power to make the <em>journey of life</em> easy to all
our fellow-travellers as well as to ourselves.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>George.</em> Harry, can you blow off all of these dandelion feathers at a
puff?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harry.</em> I will try.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> See—you have left almost half of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Can you do better?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes—look here.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> There are still several left.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span><em>Tut.</em> A pretty child’s play you have got there. Bring me one of the
dandelion heads, and let us see if we can make no other use of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Here is a very full one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Do you know what these feathers, as you call them, are?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I believe they belong to the seed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They do, and they are worth examining. Look at this single one
through my magnifying glass; you observe the seed at the bottom, like
the point of a dart. From it springs a slender hairy shaft crowned by a
very elegant spreading plume. You see it is a complete arrow of Nature’s
manufacture.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> How exact!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What a beautiful thing!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I am sure you see the use of it at once.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> It is to set the seeds a flying with the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And I suppose they sow themselves where they light?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They do. This is one of Nature’s contrivances for <em>dissemination</em>,
or that scattering of the seeds of plants which makes them reach all
the places proper for their growth. I dare say you have observed other
plants furnished with the same winged or feathered seeds.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> O yes—there are groundsel, and ragwort, and thistles.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> In a windy day I have seen the air all full of thistle-down.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Very likely: and for that reason you never saw a new-made bank
of earth, or a heap of dung in the fields, but it was presently covered with
thistles. These, and the other plants that have been named, belong to a
very extensive class, which it is worth while being acquainted with.
They are called the <em>compound-flowered plants</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Will you be so good as to give us a lecture about them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> With all my heart. Get me a dandelion in flower, a thistle-head,
and a daisy—if you cannot find a common daisy, one of the great ox-eye
daisies in the corn will do as well.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo. and Har.</em> Here they are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Very well. All these are <em>compound flowers</em>; for if you will
examine them narrowly, you will perceive that they consist of a number
of little flowers, or <em>florets</em>, enclosed in a common cup, which cup is made
of a number of scales, lying on each other like the tiles of a house.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I see it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The florets are not all alike in shape. In the dandelion you will
observe that they consist of a tube, from which, at its upper end, proceeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>a sort of strap-shaped tongue or fillet; in the thistle they are tubular or
funnel-shaped throughout; in the daisy the centre ones, which form the
<em>disk</em>, as it is called, are tubular, while those in the circumference have a
broad strap on one side, which altogether compose the <em>rays</em> of the flowers;
whence this sort are called <em>radiated</em>. Now take the glass and examine
the florets singly. Can you discern their chives and pointals?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I can.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> You may remark that there are five chives to each, the tips of
which unite into a tube, through which the pointal passes, having its
summit doubled, and curled back.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I can just make it out with the glass, but hardly with the naked eye.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is from this circumstance of the tips of the chives growing
together that Linnæus has taken his distinction of the whole class; and
he has named it <em>Syngenesia</em>, from two Greek words having that signification.
You will further observe that all these florets stand upon a stool
or receptacle at the bottom of the flower, which is the cushion left on the
dandelion-stalk after the seeds are blown away. Into this the seeds are
slightly stuck, which are one apiece to every perfect or fertile floret. This
is the general structure of the compound flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Are all their seeds feathered?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Not all. These of the daisy are not. But in a great many
species they are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I should have thought these were a very useful class of plants by
the pains nature has taken to spread them, if you had not told us that
thistles, and ragwort, and groundsel, were some of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> And if you do not confine your idea of usefulness to what is
serviceable to man, but extend it to the whole creation, you may safely
conclude, from their abundance, that they must be highly useful in the
general economy of nature. In fact, no plants feed a greater number of
insects, and none are more important to the small birds, to whom they
furnish food by their seeds, and a fine warm down for lining their nests.
On the approach of winter you may see whole flocks of linnets and goldfinches
pecking among the thistles; and you know that groundsel is a
favourite treat to birds in a cage. To man, however, they are for the
most part troublesome and unsightly weeds. Burdock, thistles, and yarrow,
overrun his hedge-banks; dandelion, and hawkweed, which much
resembles it, fill his meadows; the tall and branching ragwort, and blue
succory, cumber his pastures; and wild camomile, ox-eye, and corn-marygold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>choke up his cornfields. These plants in general have a bitter
nauseous taste, so that no cattle will touch them. Daisies, I believe, are
the chief exception.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But some of them, I suppose, are useful to man?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, several, and in various ways. Some that have milky bitter
juices are employed in medicine for purifying the blood and removing
obstructions. Of these are dandelion, succory, and sow-thistle. Many
others are bitter, and strongly aromatic; as camomile, wormwood,
southernwood, feverfew, and tansy; these are good for strengthening the
stomach and expelling worms. That capital ingredient in salad, lettuce,
is of this class, and so is endive. Artichoke forms a very singular article
of diet, for the part chiefly eaten, called the bottom, is the receptacle of
the flower, upon which the choke, or seeds with their feathers, is placed.
It is said that some of the larger species of thistles may be dressed and
eaten the same way. Then there is Jerusalem artichoke, which is the
root of a species of sunflower, and, when boiled, much resembles in
taste an artichoke bottom. On the whole, however, a very small proportion
of this class of plants is used in food.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are there no garden-flowers belonging to them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Several, especially of the autumnal ones. There are sunflowers
of various kinds, which are the largest flowers the garden produces, though
not the most sightly; marygolds, both the common, and the French and
African, asters, china-asters, golden-rod, and chrysanthemums. Very
few flowers of this class have an agreeable scent, and their shape is not
the most pleasing; but they have often gay colours, and make a figure in
the garden when other things are over. Well—this is most that I recollect
worth noticing of the compound-flowered plants. They are a difficult class
to make out botanically, though pretty easily known from each other by
sight. I will take care to point out to you the principal of them that we
meet with in our walks, and you must get acquainted with them.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ON PRESENCE OF MIND.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Mrs. F. one day having occasion to be blooded, sent for a surgeon.
As soon as he entered the room, her young daughter, Eliza, started up,
and was hastily going away, when her mother called her back.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Eliza, do not go, I want you to stay by me.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> Dear mamma! I can never bear to see you blooded.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span><em>Mrs. F.</em> Why not? what harm will it do you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> O dear! I cannot look at blood. Besides, I cannot bear to see
you hurt, mamma!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Oh, if I can bear to feel it, surely you may to see it. But,
come—you <em>must</em> stay, and we will talk about it afterward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eliza, then, pale and trembling, stood by her mother and saw the whole
operation. She could not help, however, turning her head away when
the incision was made, and the first flow of blood made her start and
shudder. When all was over, and the surgeon gone, Mrs. F. began.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Well, Eliza, what do you think of the mighty matter now?
Would it not have been very foolish to have run away from it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> O mamma! how frightened I was when he took out his lancet.
Did it not hurt you a great deal?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> No, very little. And if it had, it was to do me good, you know.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> But why should I stay to see it? I could do you no good.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Perhaps not; but it will do you good to be accustomed to such
sights.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> Why, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Because instances are every day happening in which it is our
duty to assist fellow-creatures in circumstances of pain and distress; and
if we were to indulge a reluctance to come near to them on those occasions,
we should never acquire either the knowledge or the presence of mind
necessary for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> But if I had been told how to help people in such cases, could
not I do it without being used to see them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> No. We have all naturally a horror at everything which is
the cause of pain and danger to ourselves or others; and nothing but
habit can give most of us the presence of mind necessary to enable us in
such occurrences to employ our knowledge to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> What is <em>presence of mind</em>, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> It is that steady possession of ourselves in cases of alarm, that
prevents us from being flurried and frightened. You have heard the
expression of <em>having all our wits about us</em>. That is the effect of presence
of mind, and a most inestimable quality it is, for without it we are full as
likely to run into danger as to avoid it. Do you not remember hearing of
your cousin Mary’s cap taking fire from a candle?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> O yes—very well.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Well—the maid, as soon as she saw it, set up a great scream,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>and ran out of the room; and Mary might have been burnt to death for
any assistance she could give her.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> How foolish that was!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Yes—the girl had not the least presence of mind, and the
consequence was, depriving her of all recollection, and making her entirely
useless. But as soon as your aunt came up, she took the right method
for preventing the mischief. The cap was too much on fire to be pulled
off; so she whipped a quilt from the bed and flung it round Mary’s head,
and thus stifled the flame.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> Mary was a good deal scorched, though.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Yes—but it was very well that it was no worse. If the maid,
however, had acted with any sense at first, no harm would have been
done, except burning the cap. I remember a much more fatal example of
the want of presence of mind. The mistress of a family was awakened
by flames bursting through the wainscot into her chamber. She flew to
the staircase; and in her confusion, instead of going upstairs to call her
children, who slept together in the nursery overhead, and who might all
have escaped by the top of the house, she ran down, and with much
danger made way through the fire, into the street. When she had got
thither, the thought of her poor children rushed into her mind, but it was
too late. The stairs had caught fire, so that nobody could get near them,
and they were burnt in their beds.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> What a sad thing!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Sad, indeed! Now, I will tell you of a different conduct. A
lady was awakened by the crackling of fire, and saw it shining under her
chamber-door. Her husband would have immediately opened the door,
but she prevented him, since the smoke and flame would then have burst
in upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The children with a maid slept in a room opening out of theirs. She
went and awakened them; and tying together the sheets and blankets,
she sent down the maid from the window first, and then let down the
children one by one to her. Last of all she descended herself. A few
minutes after, the floor fell in, and all the house was in flames.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> What a happy escape!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Yes—and with what cool recollection of mind it was managed!
For mothers to love their children, and be willing to run any hazards for
them, is common; but in weak minds that very love is apt to prevent
exertions in the time of danger. I knew a lady who had a fine little boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>sitting in her lap. He put a whole plum into his mouth, which slipped
into his throat and choked him. The poor fellow turned black, and
struggled violently; and the mother was so frightened, that instead of
putting her finger in his throat, and pulling out the plum, which might
easily have been done, she laid him on the floor, and ran to call for assistance.
But the maids who came up were as much flurried as she; and
the child died before anything effectual was done to relieve him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> How unhappy she must have been about it!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Yes. It threw her into an illness which had liked to have
cost her her life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another lady, seeing her little boy climb up a high ladder, set up a
violent scream that frightened the child, so that he fell down and was
much hurt; whereas, if she had possessed command enough over herself
to speak to him gently, he might have got down safely.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> Dear mamma! what is that running down your arm?—O, it is
blood!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Yes—my arm bleeds again. I have stirred it too soon.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> Dear! What shall I do?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Don’t frighten yourself. I shall stop the blood by pressing on
the orifice with my finger. In the meantime, do you ring the bell.</p>

<div class='c017'>[<em>Eliza rings—a servant comes.</em></div>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Betty, my arm bleeds. Can you tie it up again?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Betty.</em> I believe I can, madam.</p>

<div class='c017'>[<em>She takes off the bandage and puts on another.</em></div>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> I hope it is stopped now?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> It is. Betty has done it very well. You see she went about it
with composure. This accident puts me in mind of another story which
is very well worth hearing. A man once reaping in the field, cut his arm
dreadfully with his sickle, and divided an artery.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> What is that, mamma?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> It is one of the canals or pipes through which the blood from
the heart runs like water in a pipe brought from a reservoir. When one
of these is cut it bleeds very violently, and the only way to stop it is to
make a pressure between the wounded place and the heart, in order to
intercept the course of the blood toward it. Well—this poor man bled
profusely; and the people about him, both men and women, were so
stupified with fright, that some ran one way, some another, and some
stood stock still. In short, he would have soon bled to death, had not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>brisk stout-hearted wench, who came up, slipped off her garter, and bound
it tight above the wound, by which means the bleeding was stopped till
proper help could be procured.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> What a clever wench! But how did she know what to do?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> She had perhaps heard it, as you have done now; and so
probably had some of the others, but they had not presence of mind
enough to put it into practice. It is a much greater trial of courage,
however, when the danger presses upon ourselves as well as others.
Suppose a furious bull was to come upon you in the midst of a field.
You could not possibly escape him by running, and attempting it would
destroy your only chance of safety.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> What would that be?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> I have a story for that, too. The mother of that Mr. Day, who
wrote <cite>Sandford and Merton</cite>, was distinguished, as he also was, for
courage and presence of mind. When a young woman, she was one day
walking in the fields with a companion, when they perceived a bull coming
to them, roaring and tossing about his head in the most tremendous manner.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> O, how I should have screamed!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> I dare say you would; and so did her companion. But she
bid her walk away behind her as gently as she could, while she herself
stopped short, and faced the bull, eying him with a determined countenance.
The bull, when he had come near, stopped also, pawing the ground and
roaring. Few animals will attack a man who steadily waits for him. In
a while, she drew back some steps, still facing the bull. The bull followed.
She stopped, and then he stopped. In this manner, she made good her
retreat to the stile over which her companion had before got. She then
turned and sprung over it; and got clear out of danger.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> That was bravely done, indeed! But I think very few women
could have done as much.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Such a degree of cool resolution, to be sure, is not common.
But I have read of a lady in the East Indies who showed at least as much.
She was sitting out of doors with a party of pleasure, when they were
aware of a huge tiger that had crept through a hedge near them, and was
just ready to make his fatal spring. They were struck with the utmost
consternation; but she, with an umbrella in her hand, turned to the tiger,
and suddenly spread it full in his face. This unusual assault so terrified
the beast, that, taking a prodigious leap, he sprung over the fence, and
plunged out of sight into the neighbouring thicket.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><em>Eliz.</em> Well—that was the boldest thing I ever heard of! But is it
possible, mamma, to make one’s self courageous?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Courage, my dear, is of two kinds; one the gift of nature, the
other of reason and habit. Men have naturally more courage than
women; that is, they are less affected by danger; it makes a less impression
upon them, and does not flutter their spirits so much. This is owing to
the difference of their bodily constitution; and from the same cause some
men and some women are more courageous than others. But the other
kind of courage may in some measure be acquired by every one. Reason
teaches us to face smaller dangers in order to avoid greater, and even to
undergo the greatest when our duty requires it. Habit makes us less
affected by particular dangers which have often come in our way. A
sailor does not feel the danger of a storm so much as a landsman, but if
he was mounted upon a spirited horse in a fox-chase, he would probably
be the most timorous man in company. The courage of women is chiefly
tried in domestic dangers. They are attendants on the sick and dying;
and they must qualify themselves to go through many scenes of terror in
these situations, which would alarm the stoutest-hearted man who was
not accustomed to them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> I have heard that women generally bear pain and illness better
than men.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> They do so, because they are more used to them, both in
themselves and others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> I think I should not be afraid again to see anybody blooded.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> I hope not. It was for that purpose I made you stand by me.
And I would have you always force yourself to look on and give assistance
in cases of this kind, however painful it may at first be to you, that you
may as soon as possible gain that presence of mind which arises from
habit.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Eliz.</em> But would that make me like to be blooded myself?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mrs. F.</em> Not to <em>like</em> it, but to lose all foolish fears about it, and submit
calmly to it when good for you. But I hope you have sense enough to do
that already.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>WHY AN APPLE FALLS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Papa,” said Lucy, “I have been reading to-day, that Sir Isaac Newton
was led to make some of his great discoveries by seeing an apple fall from
a tree. What was there extraordinary in that?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Papa.</em> There was nothing extraordinary; but it happened to catch his
attention, and set him to thinking.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lucy.</em> And what did he think about?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> He thought by what means the apple was brought to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span><em>Lu.</em> Why, I could have told him that—because the stalk gave way, and
there was nothing to support it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> And what then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Why, then it must fall, you know.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> But why <em>must</em> it fall?—that is the point.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Because it could not help it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> But why could it not help it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I don’t know—that is an odd question. Because there was nothing
to keep it up.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Suppose there was not—does it follow that it must come to the
ground?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Yes, surely!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Is an apple animate or inanimate?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Inanimate, to be sure!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> And can inanimate things move of themselves?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> No—I think not—but the apple falls because it is forced to fall.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Right! Some force out of itself acts upon it, otherwise it would
remain for ever where it was, notwithstanding it were loosened from the
tree.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Would it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Undoubtedly! for there only two ways in which it could be moved;
by its own power of motion, or the power of something else moving it.
Now the first you acknowledge it has not; the cause of its motion must
therefore be the second. And what that is was the subject of the philosopher’s
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> But everything falls to the ground as well as an apple, when there
is nothing to keep it up.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True—there must therefore be a universal cause of this tendency
to fall.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> And what is it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Why, if things out of the earth cannot move themselves to it, there
can be no other cause of their coming together than that the earth pulls them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> But the earth is no more animate than they are: so how can it pull?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well objected! This will bring us to the point. Sir Isaac
Newton, after deep meditation, discovered, that there was a law in nature
called <em>attraction</em>, by virtue of which every particle of matter, that is,
everything of which the world is composed, draws toward it every other
particle of matter, with a force proportioned to its size and distance. Lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>two marbles on the table. They have a tendency to come together, and
if there were nothing else in the world they would come together, but they
are also attracted by the table, by the ground, and by everything besides
in the room; and these different attractions pull against each other. Now,
the globe of the earth is a prodigious mass of matter, to which nothing
near it can bear any comparison. It draws, therefore, with mighty force,
everything within its reach, which is the cause of their falling: and
this is called the <em>gravitation</em> of bodies, or what gives them <em>weight</em>.
When I lift anything, I act contrary to this force, for which reason it
seems <em>heavy</em> to me, and the heavier the more matter it contains, since
that increases the attraction of the earth for it. Do you understand this?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I think I do. It is like a loadstone drawing a needle.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yes; that is an attraction, but of a particular kind, only taking
place between the magnet and iron. But gravitation, or the attraction of
the earth, acts upon everything alike.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Then it is pulling you and me at this moment.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It is.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> But why do not we stick to the ground, then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Because, as we are alive, we have a power of self-motion, which
can, to a certain degree, overcome the attraction of the earth. But the
reason you cannot jump a mile high as well as a foot, is this attraction,
which limits the force of your jump, and brings you down again after that
force is spent.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I think, then, I begin to understand what I have heard of people
living on the other side of the world. I believe they are called <em>antipodes</em>,
who have their feet turned toward ours, and their heads in the air. I used
to wonder how it could be that they did not fall off; but I suppose the earth
pulls them to it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Very true. And whither should they fall? What have they over
their heads?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I don’t know; sky, I suppose.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> They have. This earth is a vast ball, hung in the air, and continually
spinning round, and that is the cause why the sun and stars seem
to rise and set. At noon we have the sun over our heads, when the antipodes
have the stars over theirs; and at midnight the stars are over our
heads, and the sun over theirs. So whither should they fall to more than
we?—to the stars or the sun?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> But we are up, and they are down.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span><em>Pa.</em> What is up, but <em>from</em> the earth and <em>toward</em> the sky? Their feet
touch the earth, and their heads point to the sky, as well as ours; and we
are under their feet, as much as they are under ours. If a hole were dug
quite through the earth, what would you see through it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Sky, with the sun or the stars; and now I see the whole matter
plainly. But pray what supports the earth in the air?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Why, whither should it go?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I don’t know—I suppose where there was most to draw it. I have
heard that the sun is a great many times bigger than the earth. Would
it not go to that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> You have thought very justly on the matter, I perceive. But I
shall take another opportunity of showing you how this is, and why the
earth does not fall into the sun, of which, I confess, there seems to be
some danger. Meanwhile, think how far the falling of an apple has
carried us?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> To the antipodes, and I know not where.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> You may see thence what use may be made of the commonest
fact by a thinking mind.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>NATURE AND EDUCATION.—<span class='sc'>A Fable.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Nature and Education were one day walking together through a nursery
of trees. “See,” says Nature, “how straight and fine those firs
grow—that is my doing! but as to those oaks, they are all crooked and
stunted: that, my good sister, is your fault. You have planted them too
close, and not pruned them properly.”—“Nay, sister,” said Education, “I
am sure I have taken all possible pains about them; but you gave me bad
acorns, so how should they ever make fine trees?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The dispute grew warm; and, at length, instead of blaming one another
for negligence, they began to boast of their own powers, and to challenge
each other to a contest for the superiority. It was agreed that each should
adopt a favourite, and rear it up in spite of the ill offices of her opponent.
Nature fixed upon a vigorous young Weymouth pine, the parent of which
had grown to be the mainmast of a man-of-war. “Do what you will to
this plant,” said she to her sister, “I am resolved to push it up as straight
as an arrow.” Education took under her care a crab-tree. “This,” said
she, “I will rear to be at least as valuable as your pine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Both went to work. While Nature was feeding her pine with plenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of wholesome juices, Education passed a strong rope round its top, and
pulling it downward with all its force, fastened it to the trunk of a
neighbouring oak. The pine laboured to ascend, but not being able to
surmount the obstacle, it pushed out to one side, and presently became
bent like a bow. Still, such was its vigour, that its top, after descending
as low as its branches, made a new shoot upward: but its beauty and
usefulness were quite destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crab-tree cost Education a world of pains. She pruned and pruned,
and endeavoured to bring it into shape, but in vain. Nature thrust out a
bough this way, and a knot that way, and would not push a single leading
shoot upward. The trunk was, indeed, kept tolerably straight by constant
efforts; but the head grew awry and ill-fashioned, and made a scrubby
figure. At length, Education, despairing of making a sightly plant of it,
ingrafted the stock with an apple, and brought it to bear tolerable fruit.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the end of the experiment, the sisters met to compare their respective
success. “Ah, sister!” said Nature, “I see it is in your power to
spoil the best of my works.”—“Ah, sister!” said Education, “it is a hard
matter to contend against you—however, something may be done by taking
pains enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arbury.</em> A man of the name of Goodwin.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Is he a good neighbour to you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Far from it! and I wish he had settled a hundred miles off, rather
than come here to spoil our neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> I am sorry to hear that; but what is your objection to him?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> O, there is nothing in which we agree. In the first place he is
quite of the other side in politics; and that, you know, is enough to prevent
all intimacy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> I am not entirely of that opinion; but what else?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> He is no sportsman, and refuses to join in our association for
protecting the game. Neither does he choose to be a member of any of
our clubs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Has he been asked?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span><em>Arb.</em> I don’t know that he has directly; but he might easily propose
himself, if he liked it. But he is of a close, unsociable temper, and I
believe very niggardly.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> How has he shown it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> His style of living is not equal to his fortune; and I have heard
of several instances of his attention to petty economy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Perhaps he spends money in charity?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Not he, I dare say. It was but last week that a poor fellow who
had lost his all by a fire went to him with a subscription paper, in which
were the names of all the gentlemen in the neighbourhood; and all the
answer he got was that he would consider of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> And did he consider?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> I don’t know, but I suppose it was only an excuse. Then his
predecessor had a park well stocked with deer, and used to make liberal
presents of venison to all his neighbours. But this frugal gentleman has
sold them all off, and got a flock of sheep instead.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> I don’t see much harm in that, now mutton is so dear.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> To be sure he has a right to do as he pleases with his park, but
that is not the way to be beloved, you know. As to myself, I have reason
to believe he bears me particular ill-will.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Then he is much in the wrong, for I believe you are as free from
ill-will to others as any man living. But how has he shown it, pray?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> In twenty instances. He had a horse upon sale the other day to
which I took a liking, and bid money for it. As soon as he found I was
about it, he sent it off to a fair on the other side of the county. My wife,
you know, is passionately fond of cultivating flowers. Riding lately by
his grounds, she observed something new, and took a great longing for a
root or cutting of it. My gardener mentioned her wish to his, (contrary,
I own, to my inclination,) and he told his master; but instead of obliging
her, he charged the gardener on no account to touch the plant. A little
while ago I turned off a man for saucy behaviour; but as he had lived
many years with me, and was a very useful servant, I meant to take him
again upon his submission, which I did not doubt would soon happen.
Instead of that, he goes and offers himself to my civil neighbour, who,
without deigning to apply to me even for a character, entertains him
immediately. In short, he has not the least of a gentleman about him,
and I would give anything to be well rid of him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Nothing, to be sure, can be more unpleasant, in the country, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>a bad neighbour, and I am concerned it is your lot to have one. But there
is a man who seems as if he wanted to speak with you.</p>

had made very particular inquiry about me and my losses, among my
neighbours. When I called upon him in a few days after, he told me he
was very glad to find that I bore such a good character, and that the gentlemen
round had so kindly taken up my case; and he would prevent the
necessity of my going any farther for relief. Upon which, he gave me,
God bless him! a draft upon his banker for fifty pounds.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Now, James, what have you got there?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gardener.</em> A flower, sir, for madam, from Mr. Goodwin’s.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span><em>Arb.</em> How did you come by it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gard.</em> His gardener, sir, sent me word to come for it. We should
have had it before, but Mr. Goodwin thought it would not move safely.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> I hope he has got more of them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Gard.</em> He has only a seedling plant or two, sir; but hearing that
madam took a liking to it, he resolved to send it her, and a choice thing
it is! I have a note for madam in my pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Well, go on.</p>
<div class='c017'>[<em>Exit Gardener.</em></div>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Methinks this does not look like deficiency in civility?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> No—it is a very polite action—I ca’n’t deny it, and I am obliged
to him for it. Perhaps, indeed, he may feel he owes me a little amends.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Possibly—it shows he <em>can</em> feel, however.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> It does. Ha! there’s Yorkshire Tom coming with a string of
horses from the fair. I’ll step up and speak to him. Now, Tom! how
have horses gone at Market-hill?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tom.</em> Dear enough, your honour!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> How much more did you get for Mr. Goodwin’s mare than I
offered him?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tom.</em> Ah! sir, that was not a thing for your riding, and that Mr
Goodwin well knew. You never saw such a vicious toad. She had
liked to have killed the groom two or three times. So I was ordered to
offer her to the mail-coach people, and get what I could from them. I
might have sold her better if Mr. Goodwin would have let me, for she
was a fine creature to look at as need be, and quite sound.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> And was that the true reason why the mare was not sold to me?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tom.</em> It was, indeed, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Then I am highly obliged to Mr. Goodwin. (<em>Tom rides on.</em>)
This was handsome behaviour, indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Yes, I think it was somewhat more than politeness—it was real
goodness of heart.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> It was. I find I must alter my opinion of him, and I do it with
pleasure. But, after all, his conduct with respect to my servant is somewhat
unaccountable.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> I see reason to think so well of him in the main, that I am inclined
to hope he will be acquitted in this matter, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> There the fellow is. I wonder he has my old livery on yet!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ned.</em> Sir, I was coming to your honour.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span><em>Arb.</em> What can you have to say to me now, Ned?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ned.</em> To ask pardon for my misbehaviour, and to beg you to take me again.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> What—have you so soon parted with your new master?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ned.</em> Mr. Goodwin never was my master, sir. He only kept me in his
house till I could make it up with you again; for he said he was sure you
were too honourable a gentleman to turn off an old servant without good
reason, and he hoped you would admit my excuses after your anger was over.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Did he say all that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ned.</em> Yes, sir; and he advised me not to delay any longer to ask your
pardon.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Well—go to my house, and I will talk with you on my return.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Now, my friend, what think you of this?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> I think more than I can well express. It will be a lesson to me
never to make hasty judgments again.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Why, indeed, to have concluded that such a man had nothing of
the gentleman about him must have been rather hasty.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> I acknowledge it. But it is the misfortune of these reserved
characters that they are so long in making themselves known; though,
when they are known, they often prove the most truly estimable. I am
afraid, even now, that I must be content with esteeming him at a distance.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Why so?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> You know I am of an open sociable disposition.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Perhaps he is so, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> If he was, surely we should have been better acquainted before
this time.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> It may have been prejudice rather than temper that has kept you apart.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Possibly so. The vile spirit of party has such a sway in the
country, that men of the most liberal dispositions can hardly free themselves
from its influence. It poisons all the kindness of society; and yonder
comes an instance of its pernicious effects.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> Who is he?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> A poor schoolmaster with a large family in the next market-town,
who has lost all his scholars by his activity on our side in the last election.
I heartily wish it was in my power to do something for him; for he is a
very honest man, though, perhaps, rather too warm. [<em>The schoolmaster
comes up.</em>] Now, Mr. Penman, how do things go with you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pen.</em> I thank you, sir, they have gone poorly enough, but I hope they
are in a way to mend.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span><em>Arb.</em> I am glad to hear it—but how?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pen.</em> Why, sir, the free-school of Stoke is vacant, and I believe I am
likely to get it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Ay!—I wonder at that. I thought it was in the hands of the
other party?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pen.</em> It is, sir; but Mr. Goodwin has been so kind as to give me a
recommendation, and his interest is sufficient to carry it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Mr. Goodwin! you surprise me!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pen.</em> I was much surprised, too, sir. He sent for me of his own accord,
(for I should never have thought of asking <em>him</em> a favour,) and told me he
was sorry a man should be injured in his profession on account of party,
and as I could not live comfortably where I was, he would try to settle me
in a better place. So he mentioned the vacancy of Stoke, and offered me
letters for the trustees. I was never so affected in my life, sir; I could
hardly speak to return him thanks. He kept me to dinner, and treated
me with the greatest respect. Indeed, I believe there is not a kinder man
breathing than Mr. Goodwin.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> You have the best reason in the world to say so, Mr. Penman.
What—did he converse familiarly with you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pen.</em> Quite so, sir. We talked a great deal about party affairs in this
neighbourhood, and he lamented much that differences of this kind should
keep worthy men at a distance from each other. I took the liberty, sir,
of mentioning your name. He said he had not the honour of being
acquainted with you, but he had a sincere esteem for your character, and
should be glad of any occasion to cultivate a friendship with you. For
my part, I confess, to my shame I did not think there could have been
such a man on that side.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Well—good morning!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pen.</em> Your most obedient, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Arb.</em> Can you doubt it?—to Mr. Goodwin’s, to be sure! After all I
have heard, can I exist a moment without acknowledging the injustice I
have done him, and begging his friendship?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bel.</em> I shall be happy, I am sure, to accompany you on that errand.

  <h2 class='c004'>THE LITTLE PHILOSOPHER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Mr. L. was one morning riding by himself, when dismounting to gather
a plant in the hedge, his horse got loose and galloped away before him.
He followed, calling the horse by his name, which stopped, but on his
approach set off again. At length, a little boy in a neighbouring field,
seeing the affair, ran across where the road made a turn, and getting
before the horse, took him by the bridle, and held him till his owner
came up. Mr. L. looked at the boy, and admired his ruddy, cheerful
countenance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“Thank you, my good lad!” said he; “you have caught my horse very
cleverly. What shall I give you for your trouble?” putting his hand in
his pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I want nothing, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Don’t you? so much the better for you. Few men can say as
much. But pray, what are you doing in the field?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I was rooting up weeds and tending the sheep that are feeding on
the turnips.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> And do you like this employment?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Yes, very well, this fine weather.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> But had you not rather play?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> This is not hard work; it is almost as good as play.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Who set you to work?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> My daddy, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Where does he live?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Just by, among the trees there.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> What is his name?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Thomas Hurdle.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> And what is yours?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Peter, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> How old are you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I shall be eight at Michaelmas.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> How long have you been out in this field?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Ever since six in the morning.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> And are not you hungry?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Yes—I shall go to dinner soon.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> If you had sixpence now, what would you do with it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I don’t know. I never had so much in my life.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Have you no playthings?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Playthings! what are those?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Such as balls, nine-pins, marbles, tops, and wooden horses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> No, sir; but our Tom makes footballs to kick in the cold weather,
and we set traps for birds; and then I have a jumping-pole and a pair of
stilts to walk through the dirt with; and I had a hoop, but it is broke.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> And do you want nothing else?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> No. I have hardly time for those: for I always ride the horses
to field, and bring up the cows, and run to the town of errands, and that
is as good as play, you know.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span><em>Mr. L.</em> Well, but you could buy apples or gingerbread at the town, I
suppose, if you had money?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Oh—I can get apples at home; and as for gingerbread I don’t mind
it much, for my mammy gives me a pie now and then, and that is as good.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Would you not like a knife to cut sticks?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I have one—here it is—brother Tom gave it me.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Your shoes are full of holes—don’t you want a better pair?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I have a better pair for Sundays.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> But these let in water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Oh, I don’t care for that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Your hat is all torn, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I have a better at home, but I had as leave have none at all, for it
hurts my head.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> What do you do when it rains?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> If it rains very hard, I get under the hedges till it is over.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> What do you do when you are hungry before it is time to go home?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I sometimes eat a raw turnip.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> But if there are none?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Then I do as well as I can; I work on, and never think of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Are you not dry sometimes this hot weather?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Yes, but there is water enough.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Why, my little fellow, you are quite a philosopher!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Sir?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> I say you are a philosopher, but I am sure you do not know
what that means.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> No, sir, no harm, I hope.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> No, no! (<em>Laughing.</em>) Well, my boy, you seem to want
nothing at all, so I shall not give you money to make you want anything.
But were you ever at school?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> No, sir, but daddy says I shall go after harvest.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> You will want books then.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Yes, the boys have all a spelling-book and a testament.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Well, then, I will give you them—tell your daddy so, and that
it is because I think you a very good contented little boy. So now go to
your sheep again.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> I will, sir. Thank you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. L.</em> Good-by, Peter.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Boy.</em> Good-by, sir.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>WHAT ANIMALS ARE MADE FOR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Pray, papa,” said Sophia after she had been a long time teased with
the flies that buzzed about her ears, and settled on her nose and forehead
as she sat at work—“Pray, what were flies made for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For some good, I dare say,” replied her papa.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> But I think they do a great deal more harm than good, for I am
sure they plague me sadly: and in the kitchen they are so troublesome,
that the maids can hardly do their work for them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Flies eat up many things that would otherwise corrupt and become
loathsome; and they serve for food to birds, spiders, and many other animals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> But we could clean away everything that was offensive without
their help; and as to their serving for food, I have seen whole heaps of
them lying dead in a window, without seeming to have done good to
anything.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well, then. Suppose a fly capable of thinking; would he not be
equally puzzled to find out what men were good for? “This great two-legged
monster,” he might say, “instead of helping us to live, devours more
food at a meal than would serve a whole legion of flies. Then he kills
us by hundreds when we come within his reach, and I see him destroy
and torment all other animals too. And when he dies he is nailed up in
a box, and put a great way under ground, as if he grudged doing any<a id='p216'></a>
more good after his death than when alive.” Now what would you
answer to such a reasoning fly?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> I would tell him he was very impertinent for talking so of his
betters; for that he and all other creatures were made for the use of man,
and not man for theirs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> But would you tell him true? You have just been saying that
you could not find out of what use flies were to us: whereas, when they
suck our blood, there is no doubt that we are of use to them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> It is that which puzzles me.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> There are many other animals which we call <em>noxious</em>, and which
are so far from being useful to us, that we take all possible pains to get
rid of them. More than that, there are vast tracks of the earth where few
or no men inhabit, which are yet full of beasts, birds, insects, and all
living things. These certainly do not exist there for his use alone. On
the contrary, they often keep man away.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span><em>Sop.</em> Then what are they made for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> They are made to be happy. It is a manifest purpose of the
Creator to give being to as much life as possible, for life is enjoyment to
all creatures in health and in possession of their faculties. Man surpasses
other animals in his powers of enjoyment, and he has prospects in a
future state which they do not share with him. But the Creator equally
desires the happiness of all his creatures, and looks down with as much
benignity upon these flies that are sporting around us, as upon ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> Then we ought not to kill them, if they are ever so troublesome.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> I do not say that. We have a right to make a reasonable use of
all animals for our advantage, and also to free ourselves from such as are
hurtful to us. So far our superiority over them may fairly extend. But
we should never abuse them for our mere amusement, nor take away their
lives wantonly. Nay, a good natured-man will rather undergo a <em>little</em>
inconvenience, than take away from a creature all that it possesses. An
infant may destroy life, but all the kings upon earth cannot restore it. I
remember reading of a good-tempered old gentleman that having been a
long time plagued with a great fly that buzzed about his face all dinner-time,
at length, after many efforts, caught it. Instead of crushing it to
death, he held it carefully in his hand, and opening the window, “Go,”
said he,—“get thee gone, poor creature, I won’t hurt a hair of thy head;
surely the world is wide enough for thee and me.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> I should have loved that man.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> One of our poets has written some very pretty lines to a fly that
came to partake with him of his wine. They begin:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Busy, curious, thirsty fly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drink with me, and drink as I;</div>
      <div class='line'>Welcome freely to my cup,</div>
      <div class='line'>Couldst thou sip and sip it up.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> How pretty! I think they will almost make me love flies. But
pray, papa, do not animals destroy one another?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> They do, indeed. The greatest part of them only live by the
destruction of life. There is a perpetual warfare going on, in which the
stronger prey upon the weaker, and, in their turns, are the prey of those
which are a degree stronger than themselves. Even the innocent sheep,
with every mouthful of grass, destroys hundreds of small insects. In the
air we breathe, and the water we drink, we give death to thousands of
invisible creatures.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span><em>Sop.</em> But is not that very strange? If they were created to live and be
happy, why should they be destroyed so fast?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> They are destroyed no faster than others are produced; and if they
enjoyed life while it lasted, they have had a good bargain. By making
animals the food of animals, Providence has filled up every chink, as it
were, of existence. You see these swarms of flies. During all the hot
weather they are continually coming forth from the state of eggs and
maggots, and as soon as they get the use of wings, they roam about and
fill every place in search of food. Meantime, they are giving sustenance
to the whole race of spiders; they maintain all the swallow tribe, and
contribute greatly to the support of many other small birds, and even
afford many a delicate morsel to the fishes. Their own numbers, however,
seem scarcely diminished, and vast multitudes live on till the cold
weather comes and puts an end to them. Were nothing to touch them,
they would probably become so numerous as to starve each other. As it
is, they are full of enjoyment themselves, and afford life and enjoyment
to other creatures, which in their turn supply the wants of others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> It is no charity, then, to tear a spider’s web in pieces in order to
set the fly at liberty.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> None at all—no more than it would be to demolish the traps of a
poor Indian hunter who depended upon them for his dinner. They both
act as nature directs them. Shall I tell you a story?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sop.</em> O yes—pray do!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> As a venerable Bramin, who had never in his days eaten anything
but rice, fruits, and milk, and held it the greatest of crimes to shed the
blood of anything that had life, was one day meditating on the banks of
the Ganges, he saw a little bird on the ground picking up ants as fast as
he could swallow. “Murderous wretch,” cried he, “what scores of lives
are sacrificed to one gluttonous meal of thine!” Presently, a sparrow-hawk,
pouncing down, seized him in his claws and flew off with him.
The Bramin was at first inclined to triumph over the little bird; but on
hearing his cries, he could not help pitying him. “Poor thing,” said he,
“thou art fallen into the clutches of a tyrant!” A stronger tyrant, however,
took up the matter; for a falcon in mid air darting on the sparrow-hawk,
struck him to the ground, with the bird lifeless in his talons. Tyrant
against tyrant, thought the Bramin, is well enough. The falcon had not
finished tearing his prey, when a lynx stealing from behind a rock on
which he was perched, sprung upon him, and having strangled him, bore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>him to the edge of a neighbouring thicket, and began to suck his blood.
The Bramin was attentively viewing this new display of retributive
justice, when a sudden roar shook the air, and a huge tiger rushing from
the thicket, came like thunder on the lynx. The Bramin was near enough
to hear the crushing bones, and was making off in great terror, when he
met an English soldier armed with his musket. He pointed eagerly to
the place where the tiger was making his bloody repast. The soldier
levelled his gun, and laid the tiger dead. “Brave fellow!” exclaimed the
Bramin. “I am very hungry,” said the soldier, “can you give me a beefsteak?
I see you have plenty of cows here.”—“Horrible!” cried the
Bramin; “what! I kill the sacred cows of Brama!”—“Then kill the
next tiger yourself,” said the soldier.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>TRUE HEROISM.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>You have read, my Edmund, the stories of Achilles, and Alexander,
and Charles of Sweden, and have, I doubt not, admired the high courage
which seemed to set them above all sensations of fear, and rendered them
capable of the most extraordinary actions. The world called these men
<em>heroes</em>; but before we give them that noble appellation, let us consider
what were the motives which animated them to act and suffer as they did.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first was a ferocious savage, governed by the passions of anger and
revenge, in gratifying which he disregarded all impulses of duty and
humanity. The second was intoxicated with the love of glory—swollen
with absurd pride—and enslaved by dissolute pleasures; and in pursuit
of these objects he reckoned the blood of millions as of no account. The
third was unfeeling, obstinate, and tyrannical, and preferred ruining his
country, and sacrificing all his faithful followers, to the humiliation of
giving up any of his mad projects. <em>Self</em>, you see, was the spring of all
their conduct; and a selfish man can never be a hero. I will give you
two examples of genuine heroism, one shown in acting, the other in
suffering; and these shall be <em>true stories</em>, which is perhaps more than
can be said of half that is recorded of Achilles and Alexander.</p>

<p class='c000'>You have probably heard something of Mr. Howard, the reformer of
prisons, to whom a monument is erected in St. Paul’s church. His whole
life almost was heroism; for he confronted all sorts of dangers with the
sole view of relieving the miseries of his fellow-creatures. When he
began to examine the state of prisons, scarcely any in the country were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>free from a very fatal and infectious distemper called the jail fever.
Wherever he heard of it, he made a point of seeing the poor sufferers, and
often went down into their dungeons, when the keepers themselves would
not accompany him. He travelled several times over almost the whole
of Europe, and even into Asia, in order to gain knowledge of the state of
prisons and hospitals, and point out means for lessening the calamities
that prevail in them. He even went into countries where the plague was,
that he might learn the best methods of treating that terrible contagious
disease; and he voluntarily exposed himself to perform a strict quarantine,
as one suspected of having the infection of the plague, only that he might
be thoroughly acquainted with the methods used for prevention. He at
length died of a fever caught in attending on the sick on the borders of
Crim Tartary, honoured and admired by all Europe, after having greatly
contributed to enlighten his own and many other countries with respect to
some of the most important objects of humanity. Such was <em>Howard the
good</em>; as great a hero in preserving mankind, as some of the false heroes
above mentioned were in destroying them.</p>

<p class='c000'>My second hero is a much humbler, but not less genuine one.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a journeyman bricklayer in this town—an able workman,
but a very drunken idle fellow, who spent at the alehouse almost all he
earned, and left his wife and children to shift for themselves as they
could. This is, unfortunately, a common case; and of all the tyranny
and cruelty exercised in the world, I believe that of bad husbands and
fathers is by much the most frequent and the worst.</p>

<p class='c000'>The family might have starved, but for his eldest son, whom from a
child the father brought up to help him in his work; and who was so
industrious and attentive, that being now at the age of thirteen or fourteen,
he was able to earn pretty good wages, every farthing of which, that he
could keep out of his father’s hands, he brought to his mother. And when
his brute of a father came home drunk, cursing and swearing, and in such
an ill humour, that his mother and the rest of the children durst not come
near him for fear of a beating, this good lad (Tom was his name) kept
near him, to pacify him, and get him quietly to bed. His mother, therefore,
justly looked upon Tom as the support of the family, and loved him
dearly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It chanced that one day Tom, in climbing up a high ladder with a load
of mortar on his head, missed his hold, and fell down to the bottom on a
heap of bricks and rubbish. The bystanders ran up to him, and found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>him all bloody, and with his thigh broken and bent quite under him.
They raised him up, and sprinkled water on his face to recover him from
a swoon into which he had fallen. As soon as he could speak, looking
round, with a lamentable tone he cried, “O, what will become of my poor
mother!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was carried home, I was present while the surgeon set his thigh.
His mother was hanging over him half distracted: “Don’t cry, mother!”
said he, “I shall get well again in time.” Not a word more or a groan
escaped him while the operation lasted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tom was a ragged boy that could not read or write—yet Tom has
always stood on my list of heroes.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ON METALS.<br /> <span class='large'>PART 1.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>George and Harry, with their tutor, one day in their walk, were driven
by the rain to take shelter in a blacksmith’s shop; and the shower lasting
some time, the boys, in order to amuse themselves, began to examine the
things around them. The great bellows first attracted their notice, and
they admired the roaring it made, and the expedition with which it raised
the fire to a heat too intense for them to look at. They were surprised at
the dexterity with which the smith fashioned a bar of iron into a horseshoe;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>first heating<a id='p223'></a> it, then hammering it well on the anvil, cutting off a proper
length, bending it round, turning up the ends, and lastly, punching the
nail-holes. They watched the whole process of fitting it to the horse’s
foot, and fastening it on; and it had become fair some minutes before
they showed a desire to leave the shop and proceed on their walk.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should never have thought,” says George, beginning the conversation,
“that such a hard thing as iron could have been so easily managed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nor I neither,” said Harry.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It was managed, you saw, by the help of fire. The fire made it
soft and flexible, so that the smith could easily hammer it, and cut it, and
bend it to the shape he wanted; and then dipping it in the water made it
hard again.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are all other metals managed in the same manner?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are all worked by the help of fire in some way or other,
either in melting them, or making them soft.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> There are a good many sorts of metals, are there not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, several; and if you have a mind I will tell you about them,
and their uses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Pray do, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes; I should like to hear it of all things.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well, then. First, let us consider what a metal is. Do you think
you should know one from a stone?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> A stone!—Yes, I could not mistake a piece of lead or iron for a
stone.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> How would you distinguish it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> A metal is bright and shining.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True—brilliance is one of their qualities. But glass and crystal
are very bright, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But one may see through glass, and not through a piece of metal.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Right. Metals are brilliant, but opaque, or not transparent. The
thinnest plate of metal that can be made will keep out the light as
effectually as a stone-wall.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Metals are very heavy, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. They are the heaviest bodies in nature; for the lightest
metal is nearly twice as heavy as the heaviest stone. Well, what else?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Why, they will bear beating with a hammer, which a stone
would not, without flying in pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes: that property of extending or spreading under the hammer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>is called <em>malleability</em>; and another, like it, is that of bearing to be drawn
out into a wire, which is called <em>ductility</em>. Metals have both these, and
much of their use depends upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Metals will melt, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What! will iron melt?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; all metals will melt, though some require greater heat than
others. The property of melting is called <em>fusibility</em>. Do you know
anything more about them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> No; except that they come out of the ground, I believe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is properly added, for it is this circumstance which makes
them rank among <em>fossils</em>, or minerals. To sum up their character, then,
a metal is a brilliant, opaque, heavy, malleable, ductile, and fusible mineral.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think I can hardly remember all that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The <em>names</em> may slip your memory, but you cannot see metals at
all used, without being sensible of the <em>things</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But what are <em>ores</em>? I remember seeing a heap of iron ore which
men were breaking with hammers, and it looked only like stones.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The <em>ore</em> of a metal is the state in which it is generally met with
in the earth, when it is so mixed with stony and other matters, as not to
show its proper qualities as a metal.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> How do people know it, then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> By experience. It was probably accident that in the early ages
discovered that certain fossils by the force of fire might be made to yield
a metal. The experiment was repeated on other fossils; so that in
length of time all the different metals were found out, and all the different
forms in which they lie concealed in the ground. The knowledge of this
is called <em>mineralogy</em>, and a very important science it is.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes, I suppose so: for metals are very valuable things. Our
next neighbour, Mr. Stirling, I have heard, gets a great deal of money
every year, from his mines in Wales.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> He does. The mineral riches of some countries are much superior
to that of their products above ground, and the revenues of many kings
are in great part derived from their mines.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I suppose they must be gold and silver mines?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tat.</em> Those, to be sure, are the most valuable, if the metals are found
in tolerable abundance. But do you know why they are so?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Because money is made of gold and silver.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is a principal reason, no doubt. But these metals have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>intrinsic properties that make them highly valuable, else probably they
would not have been chosen in so many countries to make money of. In
the first place, gold and silver are both <em>perfect metals</em>, that is, indestructible
in the fire. Other metals, if kept a considerable time in the fire, change
by degrees into an earthy, scaly matter, called an oxide. You have melted
lead, I dare say?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes, often.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Have you not, then, perceived a drossy film collect upon its
surface, after it had kept melting a while?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is an oxide; and in time the whole lead would change to
such a substance. You may see, too, when you have heated the poker
red-hot, some scales separate from it, which are brittle.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes, the kitchen poker is almost burnt away by putting into the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well—all metals undergo these changes, except gold and silver;
but these, if kept ever so long in the hottest fire, sustain no loss or change.
They are therefore called <em>perfect metals</em>. Gold has several other
remarkable properties. It is the heaviest of all metals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What, is it heavier than lead?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—about half as heavy again. It is between nineteen and
twenty times as heavy as an equal bulk of water. This great weight is a
ready means of discovering counterfeit gold coin from genuine; for as
gold must be adulterated with something much lighter than itself, a false
coin, if of the same weight with the true, will be sensibly bigger. Gold,
too, is the most ductile of all metals. You have seen gold-leaf?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes; I bought a book of it once.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Gold-leaf is made by beating a plate of gold placed between
pieces of skin, with heavy hammers, till it is spread out to the utmost
degree of thinness. And so great is its capacity for being extended, that
a single grain of the metal, which would be scarce bigger than a large
pin’s head, is beaten out to a surface of fifty square inches.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> That is wonderful, indeed! But I know gold-leaf must be very
thin, for it will almost float upon the air.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> By drawing gold out to a wire, it may be still farther extended.
Gold wire, as it is called, is made with silver overlaid with a small
proportion of gold, and they are drawn out together. In the wire commonly
used for laces, and embroidery, and the like, a grain of gold is made
completely to cover a length of three hundred and fifty-two feet; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>when it is stretched still farther by flatting, it will reach four hundred
and one feet.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Prodigious! What a vast way a guinea might be drawn out, then!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, the gold of a guinea at that rate would reach above nine
miles and a half. This property in gold of being capable of extension to
so extraordinary a degree, is owing to its great tenacity or cohesion of
particles, which is such, that you can scarcely break a piece of gold wire
by twisting it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Then it would make very good wire for hanging bells.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It would; but such bell-hanging would come rather too dear.
Another valuable quality of gold, is its fine colour. You know scarce
anything makes a more splendid appearance than gilding. And a peculiar
advantage of it is, that gold is not liable to rust or tarnish, as other metals
are. It will keep its colour fresh for a great many years, in a pure and
clear air.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I remember the vane of the church-steeple was new-gilt two years
ago, and it looks as well as at first.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> This property of not rusting would render gold very useful for a
variety of purposes, if it were more common. It would make excellent
cooking utensils, water-pipes, mathematical instruments, clockwork, and
the like.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But is not gold soft? I have seen pieces of gold bent double.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; it is next in softness to lead, and, therefore, when it is made
into coin, or used for any common purposes, it is mixed with a small
proportion of some other metal, in order to harden it. This is called its
<em>alloy</em>. Our gold coin has one twelfth of alloy, which is copper.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> How beautiful new gold coin is!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—scarce any metal takes a stamp or impression better; and
it is capable of a very fine polish.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What countries yield the most gold?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> South America, the East Indies, and the coast of Africa. Europe
affords but little; yet a moderate quantity is got every year from Hungary.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have heard of rivers rolling sands of gold. Is there any truth
in that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The poets, as usual, have exaggerated the matter: however, there
are various streams in different parts of the world, the sands of which
contain particles of gold, and some of them in such quantity as to be worth
the search.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span><em>Har.</em> How does the gold come there?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is washed down along with the soil from mountains by the
torrents which are the sources of rivers. Some persons say that all sands
contain gold; but I would not advise you to take the pains to search for
it in our common sand: for, in more senses than one, <em>gold may be bought
too dear</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But what a fine thing it would be to find a gold mine on one’s
estate!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Perhaps not so fine as you may imagine, for many a one does not
pay the cost of working. A coal-pit would probably be a better thing.
Who do you think are the greatest gold-finders in Europe?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I don’t know.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The gipsies in Hungary. A number of half-starved, half-naked
wretches of that community employ themselves in washing and picking
the sands of some mountain-streams in that country which contain gold,
from which they obtain just profit enough to keep body and soul together:
whereas, did they employ themselves in agriculture or manufactures, they
might have got a comfortable subsistence. Gold, almost all the world
over, is first got by slaves, and it makes slaves of those who possess much
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> For my part, I will be content with a silver mine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But we have none of those in England, have we?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> We have no silver mines, properly so called, but silver is procured
in some of our lead mines. There are, however, valuable silver mines in
various parts of Europe; but the richest of all are in Peru, in South
America.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are not the famous mines of Potosi there?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are. Shall I now tell you some of the properties of silver?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> By all means.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is another <em>perfect</em> metal. It is also as little liable to rust as
gold, though indeed it readily gets tarnished.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes; I know our footman is often obliged to clean our plate before
it is used.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Plate, however, is not made of pure silver, any more than silver
coin, and silver utensils of all kinds. Copper is mixed with it, as with
gold, to harden it; and that makes it more liable to tarnish.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Bright silver, I think, is almost as beautiful as gold.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is the most beautiful of the white metals, and is capable of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>very fine polish; and this, together with its rarity, makes it used for a
great variety of ornamental purposes. Then it is nearly as ductile and
malleable as gold.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have had silver-leaf, and it seemed as thin as gold-leaf.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is nearly so. That is used for silvering, as gold-leaf is for
gilding. It is common, too, to cover metals with a thin coating of silver
which is called plating.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> The child’s saucepan is silvered over on the inside. What is
that for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> To prevent the victuals from getting any taint from the metal of
the saucepan; for silver is not capable of being corroded or dissolved by
any of the liquids used for food, as iron and copper are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And that is the reason I suppose that fruit-knives are made of
silver.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is; but the softness of the metal makes them bear a very poor
edge.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Does silver melt easily?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Silver and gold both melt more difficultly than lead; not till they
are above a common red heat. As to the weight of silver, it is nearly
one half less than that of gold, being only eleven times as heavy as water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Is quicksilver a kind of silver?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It takes its name from silver, being very like it in colour; but in
reality it is a very different thing, and one of the most singular of the
metal kind.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> It is not <em>malleable</em>, I am sure.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No; not when it is quick or fluid, as it always is in our climate.
But a very great degree of cold makes it solid, and then it is malleable
like other metals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have heard of <em>killing</em> quicksilver; pray, what does that mean?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It means destroying its property of running about, by mixing it
with something else. Thus if quicksilver be well rubbed with fat, or oil,
or gum, it unites with them, losing all its metallic appearance or fluidity.
It also unites readily with gold and silver, and several other metals, into
a kind of shining paste, which is called an <em>amalgam</em>. This is one of
the ways of gilding or silvering a thing. Your buttons are gilt by means
of an amalgam.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> How is that done?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The shells of the buttons, which are made of copper, are shaken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>in a hat with a lump of amalgam of gold and quicksilver, till they are all
covered over with it. They are then put into a sort of frying-pan, and
held over the fire. The quicksilver, being very volatile in its nature, flies
off in the form of a smoke or vapour when it is heated, leaving the gold
behind it spread over the surface of the button. Thus many dozens are
gilt at once with the greatest ease.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What a clever way! I should like vastly to see it done.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> You may see it any day at Birmingham, if you happen to be
there; as well as a great many other curious operations on metals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What a weight quicksilver is! I remember taking up a bottleful
of it, and I had liked to have dropped it again, it was so much heavier
than I expected.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, it is one of the heaviest of the metals—about fifteen times
as heavy as water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is not <em>mercury</em> a name for quicksilver? I have heard them talk
of the mercury rising and falling in the weather-glass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is. You, perhaps, may have heard too of <em>mercurial medicines</em>,
which are those made of quicksilver prepared in one manner or another.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What are they good for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> For a great variety of complaints. Your brother took some lately
for the worms; and they are often given for breakings-out on the skin,
and for sores and swellings. But they have one remarkable effect, when
taken in a considerable quantity, which is to loosen the teeth, and cause
a great spitting. This is called salivation.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I used to think quicksilver was poison.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> When it is in its common state of running quicksilver it generally
does neither good nor harm; but it may be prepared, so as to be a very
violent medicine, or even a poison.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is it useful for anything else?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—For a variety of purposes in the arts, which I cannot now
very well explain to you. But you will perhaps be surprised to hear that
one of the finest red paints is made from quicksilver.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> A red paint!—which is that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Vermilion, or cinnabar, which is a particular mixture of sulphur
with quicksilver.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Is quicksilver found in this country?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No. The greatest quantity comes from Spain, Istria, and South
America. It is a considerable object of commerce, and bears a high value,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>though much inferior to silver. Well, so much for metals at present.
We will talk of the rest on some future opportunity.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>FLYING AND SWIMMING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“How I wish I could fly!” cried Robert, as he was gazing after his
pigeons that were exercising themselves in a morning’s flight. “How
fine it must be to soar to such a height, and to dash through the air with
so swift a motion!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I doubt not,” said his father, “that the pigeons have great pleasure in
it; but we have our pleasures, too; and it is idle to indulge longings for
things quite out of our power.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Robert.</em> But do you think it impossible for men to learn to fly?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Father.</em> I do—for I see they are not furnished by Nature with organs
requisite for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> Might not artificial wings be contrived, such as Dædalus is said
to have used?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Possibly they might; but the difficulty would be to put them in
motion.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> Why could not a man move them, if they were fastened to his
shoulders, as well as a bird?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Because he has got arms to move which the bird has not. The
same organs which in quadrupeds are employed to move the fore-legs,
and in man the arms, are used by birds in the motion of the wings. Nay,
muscles or bundles of flesh, that move the wings, are proportionally much
larger and stronger than those bestowed upon our arms; so that it is
impossible, formed as we are, that we should use wings, were they made
and fastened on with ever so much art.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> But angels, and cupids, and such things are painted with wings;
and I think they look very natural.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> To you they may appear so; but an anatomist sees them at once
to be monsters, which could not really exist.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> God might have created winged men, however, if he had pleased.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No doubt; but they could not have had the same shape that men
have now. They would have been different creatures, such as it was not
in his plan to make. But you that long to fly—consider if you have made
use of all the faculties already given you! You want to subdue the
element of air—what can you do with that of water? Can you swim?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span><em>Rob.</em> No, not yet.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Your companion, Johnson, I think, can swim very well?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Reflect, then, on the difference betwixt him and you. A boat
oversets with you both in a deep stream. You plump at once to the
bottom, and infallibly lose your life. He rises like a cork, darts away
with the greatest ease, and reaches the side in perfect safety. Both of
you, pursued by a bull, come to the side of a river. He jumps in and
crosses it. You are drowned if you attempt it, and tossed by the bull if
you do not. What an advantage he has over you! Yet you are furnished
with exactly the same bodily powers that he is. How is this?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bob.</em> Because he has been taught, and I have not.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> True, but it is an easy thing to learn, and requires no other
instruction than boys can give one another when they bathe together: so
that I wonder anybody should neglect to acquire an art at once agreeable
and useful. The Romans used to say, by way of proverb, of a blockhead,
“He can neither read nor swim.” You may remember how Cesar was
saved at Alexandria by throwing himself into the sea, and swimming
with one hand, while he held up his commentaries with the other.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> I should like very well to swim, and I have often tried, but I
always pop under water, and that daunts me.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And it is that fear which prevents you from succeeding.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> But is it as natural for man to swim as for other creatures? I
have heard that the young of all other animals swim the first time they
are thrown into the water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> They do—they are without fear. In our climate the water is
generally cold, and is early made an object of terror. But in the hot
countries, where bathing is one of the greatest pleasures, young children
swim so early and well, that I should suppose they take to it almost
naturally.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> I am resolved to learn, and will ask Johnson to take me with him
to the river.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Do; but let him find you a safe place to begin at. I don’t want
you, however, to proceed so cautiously as Sir Nicholas Gimcrack did.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> How was that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> He spread himself out on a large table, and placing before him a
basin of water with a frog in it, he struck with his arms and legs as he
observed the animal do.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span><em>Rob.</em> And did that teach him?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yes—to swim on dry land; but he never ventured himself in
the water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> Shall I get corks or bladders?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> No; learn to depend on your own powers. It is a good lesson in
other things, as well as in swimming. Learning to swim with corks, is
like learning to construe Latin with a translation on the other side. It
saves some pains at first, but the business is not done half so effectually.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE FEMALE CHOICE.—<span class='sc'>A Tale.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A young girl, having fatigued herself one hot day with running about
the garden, sat herself down in a pleasant arbour, where she presently
fell asleep. During her slumbers, two female figures presented themselves
before her. One was loosely habited in a thin robe of pink with light
green trimmings. Her sash of silver gauze flowed to the ground. Her
fair hair fell in ringlets down her neck; and her head-dress consisted of
artificial flowers interwoven with feathers. She held in one hand a ball-ticket,
and in the other a fancy-dress all covered with spangles and knots
of gay riband. She advanced smiling to the girl, and with a familiar air
thus addressed her:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dearest Melissa, I am a kind genius, who have watched you
from your birth, and have joyfully beheld all your beauties expand,
till at length they have rendered you a companion worthy of me. See
what I have brought you. This dress and this ticket will give you free
access to all the ravishing delights of my palace. With me you will pass
your days in a perpetual round of ever-varying amusements. Like the
gay butterfly, you will have no other business than to flutter from flower
to flower, and spread your charms before admiring spectators. No
restraints, no toils, no dull tasks are to be found within my happy
domains. All is pleasure, life, and good humour. Come, then, my dear!
Let me put this dress on you, which will make you quite enchanting; and
away, away, with me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Melissa felt a strong inclination to comply with the call of this inviting
nymph; but first she thought it would be prudent at least to ask her name.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My name,” said she, “is <span class='sc'>Dissipation</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The other female then advanced. She was clothed in a close habit of
brown stuff, simply relieved with white. She wore her smooth hair under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>a plain cap. Her whole person was perfectly neat and clean. Her look
was serious, but satisfied; and her air was staid and composed. She held
in one hand a distaff; on the opposite arm hung a workbasket; and the
girdle round her waist was garnished with scissors, knitting needles, reels,
and other implements of female labour. A bunch of keys hung at her side.
She thus accosted the sleeping girl:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Melissa, I am the genius who have ever been the friend and companion
of your mother; and I now offer my protection to you. I have no allurements
to tempt you with, like those of my gay rival. Instead of spending
all your time in amusements, if you enter yourself of my train, you must
rise early, and pass the long day in a variety of employments, some of
them difficult, some laborious, and all requiring some exertion of body or
mind. You must dress plainly, live mostly at home, and aim at being
useful rather than shining. But in return I will ensure you content, even
spirits, self-approbation, and the esteem of all who thoroughly know you.
If these offers appear to your young mind less inviting than those of my
rival, be assured, however, that they are more real. She has promised
much more than she can ever make good. Perpetual pleasures are no
more in the power of Dissipation, than of Vice or Folly to bestow. Her
delights quickly pall, and are inevitably succeeded by languor and disgust.
She appears to you under disguise, and what you see is not her real face.
For myself, I shall never seem to you less amiable than I now do, but, on
the contrary, you will like me better and better. If I look grave to you
now, you will hear me sing at my work; and when work is over, I can
dance too. But I have said enough. It is time for you to choose whom
you will follow, and upon that choice all your happiness depends. If you
would know my name, it is <span class='sc'>Housewifery</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Melissa heard her with more attention than delight; and though overawed
by her manner, she could not help turning again to take another
look at the first speaker. She beheld her still offering her presents with
so bewitching an air that she felt it scarcely possible to resist: when, by
a lucky accident, the mask with which Dissipation’s face was so artfully
covered, fell off. As soon as Melissa beheld, instead of the smiling features
of youth and cheerfulness, a countenance wan and ghastly with sickness,
and soured by fretfulness, she turned away with horror, and gave her hand
unreluctantly to her sober and sincere companion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Tutor</em>—<em>George</em>—<em>Harry</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Tutor.</em> Well—have you forgotten what I told you about metals the
other day?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>George.</em> O no!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harry.</em> I am sure I have not.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> What metals were they that we talked about?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Gold, silver, and quicksilver.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span><em>Tut.</em> Suppose, then, we go on to the rest?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Pray, do.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes, by all means.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Very well. You know <em>copper</em>, I don’t doubt?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> O yes!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> What colour do you call it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think it is a sort of reddish brown.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. Sometimes, however, it is of a bright red, like sealing-wax.
It is not a very heavy metal, being not quite nine times the weight of
water. It is very ductile, bearing to be rolled or hammered out to a very
thin plate, and also to be drawn out to a fine wire.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I remember seeing a penny that had been rolled out to a long riband.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes, and I have seen half a dozen men at a time with great
hammers beating out a piece of copper at the brazier’s.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Copper requires a very considerable heat to melt it: and by long
exposure to the fire, it may be burnt or calcined; for, like all we are now
to speak of, it is an <em>imperfect</em> metal.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And it rusts very easily, does it not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It does; for all acids dissolve or corrode it, so do salts of every
kind: whence even air and common water in a short time act upon it, for
they are never free from somewhat of a saline nature.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is not verdigris the rust of copper?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is; a rust produced by the acid of grapes. But every rust of
copper is of a blue or green colour, as well as verdigris.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And are they all poison, too?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are all so in some degree, producing violent sickness and
pain in the bowels. They are all, too, extremely nauseous to the taste,
and the metal itself when heated, tastes and smells very disagreeably.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Why is it used, then, so much in cooking, brewing, and the like?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Because it is a very convenient metal for making vessels, especially
large ones, as it is easily worked, and is sufficiently strong, though
hammered thin, and bears the fire well. And if vessels of it are kept
quite clean, and the liquor not suffered to stand long in them when cold
there is no danger in their use. But copper vessels for cooking are
generally lined on the inside with tin.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What else is copper used for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> A variety of things. Sheets of copper are sometimes used to
cover buildings; and of late a great quantity is consumed in sheathing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>ships, that is, in covering all the part under water; the purpose of which
is, to protect the timber from the worms, and also to make the ship sail
faster, by means of the smoothness and therefore less obstruction which
the copper offers to the water, as the ship is forced through it by the
action of the wind on the sails.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Money is made of copper, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is; for it takes an impression in coining very well, and its value
is a proper proportion below silver, for a price for the cheapest commodities.
In some poor countries they have little other than copper coin. Another
great use of copper is as an ingredient in mixed metals, such as bell-metal,
cannon-metal, and particularly brass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But brass is yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True; it is converted to that colour by means of another metallic
substance, named <em>zinc</em> or <em>spelter</em>, the natural colour of which is white.
A kind of brown stone called <em>calamine</em> is an ore of zinc. By filling a pot
with layers of powdered calamine and charcoal placed alternately with
copper, and applying a pretty strong heat, the zinc is driven in vapour out
of the calamine, and penetrates the copper, changing it into brass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What is the use of turning copper into brass?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It gains a fine gold-like colour, and becomes harder, more easy to
melt, and less liable to rust. Hence it is preferred for a variety of utensils,
ornamental and useful. Brass does not bear hammering well, but is
generally cast into the shape wanted, and then turned in a lathe and
polished. Well—these are the principal things I have to say about copper.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But where does it come from?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Copper is found in many countries. The Isle of Great Britain
yields abundance, especially in Wales and Cornwall. In Anglesey is a
whole hill called Paris Mountain, consisting of copper-ore, from which
immense quantities are dug every year. Now for <em>iron</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Ay! that is the most useful of all the metals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I think it is; and it is likewise the most common, for there are few
countries in the world possessing hills and rocks, where it is not met with,
more or less. Iron is the hardest of metals, the most elastic or springy,
very tenacious or difficult to break, the most difficultly fusible, and one of
the lightest, being only seven or eight times as heavy as water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> You say it is difficult to break; but I snapped the blade of a penknife
the other day by only bending it a little; and my mother is continually
breaking her needles.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span><em>Tut.</em> Properly objected; but the qualities of iron differ extremely
according to the method of preparing it. There are forged iron, cast iron,
and steel, which are very different from each other. Iron, when first
melted from its ore, has little malleability, and the vessels and other
implements that are made of it in that state, by casting into moulds, are
easily broken. It acquires toughness and malleability by <em>forging</em>, which
is done by beating it when red-hot with heavy hammers, till it becomes
ductile and flexible. Steel, again, is made by<a id='p237'></a> heating small bars of iron
with charcoal, bone, and horn shavings, or other inflammable matters, by
which it acquires a finer grain and more compact texture, and becomes
harder, and more elastic. Steel may be rendered either very flexible or
brittle, by different manners of <em>tempering</em>, which is performed by heating
and then quenching it in water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> All cutting instruments are made of steel, are they not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; and the very fine-edged ones are generally tempered brittle,
as razors, penknives, and surgeons’ instruments; but sword-blades are
made flexible, and the best of them will bend double without breaking or
becoming crooked. The steel of which springs are made has the highest
possible degree of elasticity given it. A watch-spring is one of the most
perfect examples of this kind. Steel for ornaments is made extremely
hard and close-grained, so as to bear an exquisite polish. Common
hammered iron is chiefly used for works of strength, as horseshoes, bars,
bolts, and the like. It will bend but not straighten itself again, as you
may see in the kitchen poker. Cast iron is used for pots and caldrons,
cannons, cannon-balls, grates, pillars, and many other purposes in which
hardness without flexibility is wanted.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What a vast variety of uses this metal is put to!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; I know not when I should have done, if I were tell you of all.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Then I think it is really more valuable than gold, though it is so
much cheaper.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That was the opinion of the wise Solon, when he observed to the
rich king Crœsus, who was showing him his treasures, “He who possesses
more iron will soon be master of all this gold.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I suppose he meant weapons and armour?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> He did; but there are many nobler uses for these metals; and
few circumstances denote the progress of the arts in a country more than
having attained the full use of iron, without which scarcely any manufacture
or machinery can be brought to perfection. From the difficulty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>melting it out of the ore, many nations have been longer in discovering it
than some of the other metals. The Greeks, in Homer’s time, seem to
have employed copper or brass for their weapons much more than iron;
and the Mexicans and Peruvians, who possessed gold and silver, were
unacquainted with iron, when the Spaniards invaded them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Iron is very subject to rust, however.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is so, and that is one of its worst properties. Every liquor, and
even a moist air corrode it. But the rust of iron is not pernicious: on the
contrary, it is a very useful medicine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have heard of steel drops and steel filings given for medicine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; iron is given in a variety of forms, and the property of them
all is to strengthen the constitution. Many springs are made medicinal
by the iron that they dissolve in the bowels of the earth. These are called
<em>chalybeate</em> waters, and they may be known by their inky taste, and the
rust-coloured sediment they leave in their course.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> May we drink such water if we meet with it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; it will do you no harm, at least. There is one other property
of iron, well worth knowing, and that is, that it is the only thing attracted
by the magnet or loadstone.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I had a magnet once that would take up needles and keys; but it
seemed a bar of iron itself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. The real loadstone, which is a particular ore of iron, can
communicate its virtue to a piece of iron by rubbing it; nay, a bar of iron
itself, in length of time, by being placed in a particular position, will
acquire the same property.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is all the iron used in England produced there?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> By no means. Their extensive manufactures require a great
importation of iron. Much is brought from Norway, Russia, and Sweden;
and the Swedish is reckoned particularly excellent. Well, now to another
metal. I dare say you can tell me a good deal about <em>lead</em>?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I know several things about it. It is very heavy and soft, and
easily melted.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True; these are some of its distinguishing properties. Its weight
is between eleven and twelve times that of water. Its colour is a dull
bluish white; and from this livid hue, as well as its being totally void of
spring or elasticity, it has acquired a sort of character, of dulness and
sluggishness. Thus we say of a stupid man, that he has a <em>leaden</em> disposition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span><em>Geo.</em> Lead is very malleable, I think?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; it may be beaten out into a pretty thin leaf, but it will not
bear drawing into fine wire. It is not only very fusible, but very readily
oxidized by heat, changing into a powder, or a scaly matter, which may
be made to take all colours by the fire, from yellow to deep red. You
have seen red lead?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is oxide of lead exposed for a considerable time to a strong
flame. Lead may even be changed into glass by a moderate heat; and
there is a good deal of it in our finest glass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What is white lead?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is lead corroded by the steam of vinegar. Lead in various
forms is much used by painters. Its oxides dissolve in oil, and are
employed for the purpose of thickening paint and making it dry. All lead
paints, however, are unwholesome as long as they continue to smell, and
the fumes of lead, when melted, are likewise pernicious. This is the
cause why painters and plumbers are so subject to various diseases, particularly
violent colics and palsies. The white-lead manufacture is so
hurtful to the health, that the workmen, in a very short time, are apt to
lose the use of their limbs, and be otherwise severely indisposed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I wonder, then, that anybody will work in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Ignorance and high wages are sufficient to induce them. But it
is to be lamented that in a great many manufactures the health and lives
of individuals are sacrificed to the convenience and profit of the community.
Lead, too, when dissolved, as it may be in all sour liquors, is a
slow poison, and the more dangerous, as it gives no disagreeable taste. A
salt of lead made with vinegar, is so sweet, as to be called the sugar of
lead. It has been too common to put this or some other preparation of
lead into sour wines, in order to cure them; and much mischief has been
done by this practice.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> If lead is poisonous, is it not wrong to make water-pipes and
cisterns of it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> This has been objected to; but it does not appear that water can
dissolve any of the lead. Nor does it readily rust in the air, and hence
it is much used to cover buildings with, as well as to line spouts and
water-courses. For these purposes the lead is cast into sheets, which are
easily cut and hammered into any shape.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Bullets and shot, too, are made of lead.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span><em>Tut.</em> They are; and in this way they are ten times more destructive
than as a poison.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think lead seems to be more used than any metal except iron.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is; and the plenty of it in our country is a great benefit to us,
both for domestic use, and as an article that brings in much profit by
exportation.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Where are our principal lead mines?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are much scattered about. The west of England produces
some, in Cornwall, Devonshire, and Somersetshire. Wales affords a
large quantity. Derbyshire has long been noted for its lead mines, and
so have Northumberland and Durham. And there are considerable ones
in the southern part of Scotland. Now do you recollect another metal to
be spoken about?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Tin.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. Tin resembles lead in colour, but has a more silvery
whiteness. It is soft and flexible, like lead, but is distinguished by the
crackling noise it makes on being bent. It melts as easily as lead, and
also is readily oxidized by keeping it in the fire. It is the lightest of the
metals, being only seven times as heavy as water. It may be beaten into
a thin leaf, but not drawn out to wire.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is tin of much use?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is not often used by itself, but very frequently in conjunction
with other metals. As tin is little liable to rust, or to be corroded by
common liquors, it is employed for a lining or coating of vessels made of
copper or iron. The saucepans and kettles in the kitchen, you know, are
all tinned.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes; how is it done?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> By melting the tin, and spreading it upon the surface of the copper,
which is first heated, in order to make the tin adhere.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But what are the vessels made at the tinman’s? Are they not
all tin?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No. <em>Tinned</em> ware, as it is properly called, is made of thin iron
plates, coated over with tin by dipping them into a vessel full of melted
tin. These plates are afterward cut and bent to proper shapes, and the
joinings are soldered together with a mixture of tin and other metals.
Another similar use of tin is in what is called the silvering of pins.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> What—is not that real silvering?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No. The pins which are made of brass wire, after being pointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>and headed, are boiled in hot water, in which grain-tin is put along with
tartar, which is a crust that collects on the inside of wine casks. The
tartar dissolves some of the tin, and makes it adhere to the surface of the
pins, and thus thousands are covered in an instant.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> That is as clever as what you told us of the gilding of buttons!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is. Another purpose for which great quantities of tin used to
be employed was the making of pewter. The best pewter consists chiefly
of tin, with a small mixture of other metals to harden it; and the London
pewter was brought to such perfection as to look almost as well as silver.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I can just remember a long row of pewter plates at my grandmother’s.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> You may. In her time all the plates and dishes for the table were
made of pewter, and a handsome range of pewter shelves was thought a
capital ornament for a kitchen. At present, this trade is almost come to
nothing, through the use of earthenware and china; and pewter is
employed for little but the worms of stills, and barbers’ basins, and porter-pots.
But a good deal is still exported. Tin is likewise an ingredient
in other mixed metals for various purposes, but, on the whole, less of it is
used than of the other common metals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is not England more famous for tin than any other country? I<a id='p241'></a>
have read of the Phoenicians trading here for it in very early times.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They did; and tin is still a very valuable article of export from
England. Much of it is sent as far as China. The tin mines are chiefly
in Cornwall, England, and I believe they are the most productive of any
in Europe. Very fine tin is also got in the peninsula of Malacca in the
East Indies. Well—we have now gone through the metals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But you said nothing about a kind of metal called zinc.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is one of another class of mineral substances called <em>semi-metals</em>.
These resemble metals in every quality but ductility, of which
they are almost wholly destitute, and for want of it they can seldom be
used in the arts, except when joined with metals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are there many of them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, several; but we will not talk of them till I have taken some
opportunity of showing them to you, for probably you may never have
seen any of them. Now try to repeat the names of all the metals to me
in the order of their weight.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> There is first <em>gold</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Then <em>quicksilver</em>, <em>lead</em>, <em>silver</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span><em>Har.</em> <em>Copper</em>, <em>iron</em>, <em>tin</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Very right. Now I must tell you of an old fancy that chymists
have had of christening these metals by the names of the heavenly bodies.
They have called gold <em>Sol</em>, or the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> That is suitable enough to its colour and brightness.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Then silver should be the moon, for I have heard moonlight
called of a silvery hue.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True; and they have named it so. It is <em>Luna</em>. Quicksilver is
<em>Mercury</em>, so named probably from its great propensity to dance and jump
about, for <em>Mercury</em>, you know, was very nimble.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes—he had wings to his heels.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Copper is <em>Venus</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> <em>Venus!</em> surely it is scarcely beautiful enough for that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> But they had disposed of the most beautiful ones before. Iron is
Mars.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> That is right enough, because swords are made of iron.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. Then tin is <em>Jupiter</em>, and lead <em>Saturn</em>. I suppose only to
make out the number. Yet the dulness of lead might be thought to agree
with that planet which is most remote from the sun. These names,
childish as they may seem, are worth remembering, since chymists and
physicians still apply them to many preparations of the various metals.
You will, probably, often hear of <em>martial</em>, <em>lunar</em>, <em>mercurial</em>, and <em>saturnine</em>;
and you may now know what they mean.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think the knowledge of metals seems more useful than all you
have told us about plants.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I don’t know that. Many nations make no use at all of metals,
but there are none which do not owe a great part of their subsistence to
vegetables. However, without inquiring what parts of natural knowledge
are <em>most</em> useful, you may be assured of this, that all are useful in some
degree or other; and there are few things that give one man greater
superiority over another, than the extent and accuracy of his knowledge
in these particulars. One person passes all his life upon the earth, a
stranger to it; while another finds himself at home everywhere.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>EYES AND NO EYES; OR, THE ART OF SEEING.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Well, Robert, where have you been walking this afternoon?” said
Mr. Andrews to one of his pupils, at the close of a holyday.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span><em>Robert.</em> I have been, sir, to Broom-heath, and so round by the windmill
upon Camp-mount, and home through the meadows by the river-side.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Andrews.</em> Well, that’s a pleasant round.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> I thought it very dull, sir; I scarcely met with a single person.
I had rather by half have gone along the turnpike-road.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Why, if seeing men and horses is your object, you would,
indeed, be better entertained on the high-road. But did you see William?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> We set out together, but he lagged behind in the lane, so I walked
on and left him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> That was a pity. He would have been company for you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> O, he is so tedious, always stopping to look at this thing and that!
I had rather walk alone. I dare say he is not got home yet.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Here he comes. Well, William, where have you been?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>William.</em> O, sir, the pleasantest walk! I went all over Broom-heath,
and so up to the mill at the top of the hill, and then down among the
green meadows by the side of the river.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Why, that is just the round Robert has been taking, and he
complains of its dulness, and prefers the high-road!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I wonder at that. I am sure I hardly took a step that did not
delight me, and I have brought my handkerchief full of curiosities home.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Suppose, then, you give us some account of what amused you
so much. I fancy it will be as new to Robert as to me.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I will, sir. The lane leading to the heath, you know, is close
and sandy, so I did not mind it much, but made the best of my way.
However, I spied a curious thing enough in the hedge. It was an old
crab-tree, out of which grew a great bunch of something green, quite
different from the tree itself. Here is a branch of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Ah! this is mistletoe, a plant of great fame for the use made
of it by the Druids of old, in their religious rites and incantations. It
bears a very slimy white berry, of which bird-lime may be made, whence
its Latin name of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viscus</span></i>. It is one of those plants which do not grow
in the ground by a root of their own, but fix themselves upon other plants;
whence they have been humorously styled <em>parasitical</em>, as being hangers-on,
or dependants. It was the mistletoe of the oak that the Druids particularly
honoured.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> A little farther on I saw a green woodpecker fly to a tree, and
run up the trunk like a cat.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> That was to seek for insects in the bark, on which they live.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>They bore holes with their strong bills for that purpose, and do much
damage to the trees by it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> What beautiful birds they are!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Yes; they have been called, from their colour and size, the
English parrot.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> When I got upon the open heath, how charming it was! The
air seemed so fresh, and the prospect on every side so free and unbounded!
Then it was all covered with gay flowers, many of which I had never
observed before. There were, at least, three kinds of heath, (I have got
them in my handkerchief here,) and gorse, and broom, and bellflower, and
many others of all colours, that I will beg you presently to tell me the
names of.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> That I will readily.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I saw, too, several birds that were new to me. There was a
pretty grayish one, of the size of a lark, that was hopping about some
great stones; and when he flew he showed a great deal of white above
his tail.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> That was a wheat-ear. They are reckoned very delicious
birds to eat, and frequent the open downs in Sussex, and some other
counties, in great numbers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> There was a flock of lapwings, upon a marshy part of the heath,
that amused me much. As I came near them, some of them kept flying
round and round just over my head, and crying <em>pewit</em> so distinctly, one
might almost fancy they spoke. I thought I should have caught one of
them, for he flew as if one of his wings was broken, and often tumbled
close to the ground; but as I came near, he always made a shift to get
away.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Ha, ha! you were finely taken in then! This was all an
artifice of the bird to entice you away from its nest; for they build upon
the bare ground, and their nests would easily be observed, did they not
draw off the attention of intruders by their loud cries and counterfeit
lameness.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I wish I had known that, for he led me a long chase often over
shoes in water. However, it was the cause of my falling in with an old
man and a boy who were cutting and piling up turf for fuel, and I had a
good deal of talk with them about the manner of preparing the turf, and
the price it sells at. They gave me, too, a creature I never saw before—a
young viper, which they had just killed, together with its dam. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>seen several common snakes, but this is thicker in proportion, and of a
darker colour than they are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> True. Vipers frequent those turfy, boggy grounds pretty
much, and I have known several turf-cutters bitten by them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> They are very venomous, are they not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Enough so to make their wounds painful and dangerous, though
they seldom prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> Well—I then took my course up to the windmill on the mount.
I climbed up the steps of the mill, in order to get a better view of the
country round. What an extensive prospect! I counted fifteen church-steeples;
and I saw several gentlemen’s houses peeping out from the
midst of green woods and plantations; and I could trace the windings
of the river all along the low grounds, till it was lost behind a ridge of
hills. But I’ll tell you what I mean to do, sir, if you will give me
leave.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> What is that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I will go again, and take with me Cary’s county-map, by which
I shall probably be able to make out most of the places.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> You shall have it, and I will go with you and take my pocket
spying-glass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I shall be very glad of that. Well, a thought struck me, that as
the hill is called Camp-mount, there might probably be some remains of
ditches and mounds with which I have read that camps were surrounded.
And I really believe I discovered something of that sort running round
one side of the mount.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Very likely you might. I know antiquaries have described
such remains as existing there, which some suppose to be Roman, others
Danish; we will examine them farther, when we go.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> From the hill I went straight down to the meadows below, and
walked on the side of a brook that runs into the river. It was all bordered
with reeds and flags and tall towering plants, quite different from those I
had seen on the heath. As I was getting down the bank to reach one of
them, I heard something plunge into the water near me. It was a large
water-rat, and I saw it swim over to the other side, and go into its hole.
There were a great many large dragon-flies all about the stream; I caught
one of the finest, and have got him here in a leaf. But how I longed to
catch a bird that I saw hovering over the water, and every now and then
darting down into it! It was all over a mixture of the most beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>green and blue with some orange colour. It was somewhat less than a
thrush, and had a large head and bill, and a short tail.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> I can tell you what that bird was—a kingfisher; the celebrated
halcyon of the ancients, about which so many tales are told. It lives on
fish, which it catches in the manner you saw. It builds in holes in the
banks, and is a shy retired bird, never to be seen far from the stream
where it inhabits.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I must try to get another sight of him, for I never saw a bird that
pleased me so much. Well—I followed this little brook till it entered
the river, and then took the path that runs along the bank. On the
opposite side I observed several little birds running along the shore, and
making a piping noise. They were brown and white, and about as big
as a snipe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> I suppose they were sand-pipers, one of the numerous family
of birds that get their living by wading among the shallows, and picking
up worms and insects.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> There were a great many swallows, too, sporting upon the surface
of the water, that entertained me with their motions. Sometimes they
dashed into the stream; sometimes they pursued one another so quick,
that the eye could scarcely follow them. In one place, where a high,
steep sandbank rose directly above the river, I observed many of them go
in and out of holes with which the bank was bored full.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Those were sand-martens, the smallest of our species of
swallows. They are of a mouse-colour above, and white beneath. They
make their nests and bring up their young in these holes, which run a
great depth, and, by their situation, are secure from all plunderers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> A little farther I saw a man in a boat who was catching eels
in an odd way. He had a long pole with broad iron prongs at the end,
just like Neptune’s trident, only there were five instead of three. This
he pushed straight down among the mud in the deepest parts of the river,
and fetched up the eels sticking between the prongs.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> I have seen this method. It is called spearing of eels.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> While I was looking at him, a heron came flying over my head,
with his large flagging wings. He lit at the next turn of the river, and I
crept softly behind the bank to watch his motions. He had waded into
the water as far as his long legs would carry him, and was standing with
his neck drawn in, looking intently on the stream. Presently, he darted
his long bill as quick as lightning into the water, and drew out a fish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>which he swallowed. I saw him catch another in the same manner.
He then took alarm at some noise I made, and flew away slowly to a
wood at some distance, where he settled.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Probably his nest was there, for herons build upon the loftiest
trees they can find, and sometimes in society together, like rooks.
Formerly, when these birds were valued for the amusement of hawking,
many gentlemen had their <em>heronries</em>, and a few are still remaining.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I think they are the largest wild birds we have.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> They are of a great length and spread of wing, but their bodies
are comparatively small.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I then turned homeward across the meadows, where I stopped a
while to look at a large flock of starlings which kept flying about at no
great distance. I could not tell at first what to make of them; for they
rose all together from the ground as thick as a swarm of bees, and formed
themselves into a kind of black cloud, hovering over the field. After
having a short round they settled again, and presently rose again in the
same manner. I dare say there were hundreds of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Perhaps so, for in the fenny countries their flocks are so
numerous as to break down whole acres of reeds by settling on them.
This disposition of starlings to fly in close swarms was remarked even by
Homer, who compares the foe flying from one of his heroes, to a <em>cloud</em>
of stares retiring dismayed at the approach of the hawk.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> After I had left the meadows, I crossed the cornfields in the
way to our house, and passed by a deep marl-pit. Looking into it, I saw
in one of the sides a cluster of what I took to be shells; and upon going
down, I picked up a clod of marl, which was quite full of them; but how
sea-shells could get there I cannot imagine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> I do not wonder at your surprise, since many philosophers
have been much perplexed to account for the same appearance. It is not
uncommon to find great quantities of shells and relics of marine animals
even in the bowels of high mountains, very remote from the sea. They
are certainly proofs that the earth was once in a very different state from
what it is at present; but in what manner, and how long ago these changes
took place, can only be guessed at.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I got to the high field next our house just as the sun was setting,
and I stood looking at it till it was quite lost. What a glorious sight!
The clouds were tinged purple, and crimson, and yellow, of all shades
and hues, and the clear sky varied from blue to a fine green at the horizon.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>But how large the sun appears just as it sets! I think it seems twice as
big as when it is overhead.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> It does so; and you may probably have observed the same
apparent enlargement of the moon at its rising.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Will.</em> I have; but pray, what is the reason of this?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> It is an optical deception, depending upon principles which I
cannot well explain to you till you know more of that branch of science.
But what a number of new ideas this afternoon’s walk has afforded you!
I do not wonder that you found it amusing: it has been very instructive,
too. Did <em>you</em> see nothing of all these sights, Robert?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> I saw some of them, but I did not take particular notice of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> Why not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Rob.</em> I don’t know. I did not care about them, and I made the best of
my way home.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. An.</em> That would have been right if you had been sent with a
message; but as you only walked for amusement, it would have been
wiser to have sought out as many sources of it as possible. But so it is—one
man walks through the world with his eyes open, and another with
them shut; and upon this difference depends all the superiority of
knowledge the one acquires above the other. I have known sailors who
had been in all the quarters of the world, and could tell you nothing but
the signs of the tippling-houses they frequented in different ports, and the
price and quality of the liquor. On the other hand, a Franklin could not
cross the channel without making some observations useful to mankind.
While many a vacant, thoughtless youth is whirled throughout Europe
without gaining a single idea worth crossing a street for, the observing
eye and inquiring mind find matter of improvement and delight in every
ramble in town or country. Do <em>you</em>, then, William, continue to make
use of your eyes: and <em>you</em>, Robert, learn that eyes were given you to use.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>WHY THE EARTH MOVES ROUND THE SUN.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Papa</em>—<em>Lucy</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Papa.</em> You remember, Lucy, that I explained to you some time ago
what was the cause that things fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lucy.</em> O yes; it was because the ground drew them to it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True. That is a consequence of the universal law in nature, that
bodies attract each other in proportion to their bulk. So a very small
thing in the neighbourhood of a very large one, always tends to go to it,
if not prevented by some or other power. Well—you know I told you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>that the sun was a ball a vast many times bigger than the ball we inhabit,
called the earth; upon which you properly asked, how then it happened
that the earth did not fall into the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> And why does it not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> That I am going to explain to you. You have seen your brother
whirl round an ivory ball tied to the end of a string, which he held in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Yes; and I have done it myself, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well, then—you felt that the ball was continually pulling, as if it
tried to make its escape?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Yes; and one my brother was swinging <em>did</em> make its escape, and
flew through the sash.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It did so. That was a lesson, in the <em>centrifugal</em> motion, or that
power by which a body thus whirled, continually endeavours to fly off
from the centre round which it moves. This is owing to the force or
impulse you give it at setting out, as if you were going to throw it away
from you. The string by which you hold it, on the contrary, is the power
which keeps the ball toward the centre, called the <em>centripetal</em> power.
Thus you see there are two powers acting upon the ball at the same time,
one to make it fly off, the other to hold it in; and the consequence is, that
it moves directly according to neither, but between both; that is, round
and round. This it continues to do while you swing it properly; but if
the string breaks or slips off, away flies the ball; on the other hand, if you
cease to give it the whirling force, it falls toward your hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I understand all this.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> I will give you another instance of this double force acting at the
same time. Do not you remember seeing some curious feats of horsemanship?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Yes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> One of them was, that a man standing with one leg upon the
saddle, and riding full speed, threw up balls into the air, and catched them
as they fell.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I remember it very well.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Perhaps you would have expected these balls to have fallen behind
him, as he was going at such a rate?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> So I did.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> But you saw that they fell into his hand as directly as if he had
been standing quite still. That was because at the instant he threw them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>up, they received the motion of the horse straight forward as well as the
upright motion that he gave them, so that they made a slanting line through
the air, and came down in the same place they would have reached if he
had held them in his hand all the while.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> That is very curious, indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> In the same manner you may have observed, in riding in a carriage,
that if you throw anything out of the window, it falls directly opposite,
just as if the carriage was standing still, and is not left behind you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I will try that the next time I ride in one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> You are then to imagine the sun to be a mighty mass of matter,
many thousand times bigger than our earth, placed in the centre, quiet
and unmoved. You are to conceive our earth, as soon as created,
launched with vast force in a straight line, as if it were a bowl on a green.
It would have flown off in this line for ever, through the boundless regions
of space, had it not at the same instant received a pull from the sun by its
attraction. By the wonderful skill of the Creator, these two forces were
made exactly to counterbalance each other; so that just as much as the
earth, from the original motion given to it, tends to fly forward, just so
much the sun draws it to the centre; and the consequence is, that it takes
a course between the two, which is a circle round and round the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> But if the earth was set a rolling like a bowl upon a green, I should
think it would stop of itself, as the bowl does.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> The bowl stops because it is continually rubbing against the
ground, which checks its motion, but the ball of the earth moves in empty
space, where there is nothing to stop it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> But if I throw a ball through the air, it will not go on for ever, but
it will come down to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> That is because the force with which you can throw it is much
less than the force by which it is drawn to the earth. But there is another
reason, too, which is the resistance of the air. This space all round us
and over us is not empty space; it is quite full of a thin transparent
fluid called air.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Is it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yes. If you move your hand quickly through it, you will find
something resisting you, though in a slight degree. And the wind, you
well know, is capable of pressing against anything with almost irresistible
force; and yet wind is nothing but a quantity of air put into violent
motion. Everything, then, that moves through the air is continually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>obliged to push some of this fluid out of the way, by which means it is
constantly losing part of its motion.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Then the earth would do the same?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> No; for it moves in <em>empty space</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> What, does it not move through the air?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> The earth does not move <em>through</em> the air, but carries the air along
with it. All the air is contained in what is called the <em>atmosphere</em>, which
you may compare to a kind of mist or fog clinging all round to the ball of
the earth, and reaching a certain distance above it, which has been
calculated at above forty-five miles.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> That is above the clouds, then.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yes: all the clouds are within the atmosphere, for they are
supported by the air. Well—this atmosphere rolls about along with the
earth, as if it were a part of it, and moves with it through the sky, which
is a vast field of empty space. In this immense space are all the stars
and planets, which have also their several motions. There is nothing to
stop them, and therefore they continually go on, by means of the force that
the Creator has originally impressed upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Do not some of the stars move round the sun, as well as our earth?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yes; those that are called <em>planets</em>. These are all subject to the
same laws of motion with our earth. They are attracted by the sun as
their centre, and form, along with the earth, that assemblage of worlds,
which is called the <em>solar system</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Is the moon one of them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> The moon is called a <em>secondary</em> planet, because its immediate
connexion is with our earth, round which it rolls, as we do round the sun.
It, however, accompanies our earth on its journey round the sun. But I
will tell you more about its motion, and about the other planets and stars
another time. It is enough at present, if you thoroughly understand what
I have been describing.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I think I do.</p>

<p class='c005'><em>Harry.</em> What plant is that man gathering under the hedge?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>George.</em> I don’t know; but the boys call the stalks <em>hexes</em>, and blow
through them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span><em>Har.</em> I have seen them; but I want to know the plant.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Will you please to tell us, sir, what it is?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tutor.</em> It is hemlock.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Hemlock is poison is it not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, in some degree; and it is also a medicine; that man is
gathering it for the apothecaries.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I should like to know it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well then—go and bring one.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>[Harry <em>fetches it</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think I have seen a great many of this sort.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Perhaps you may; but there are many other kinds of plants
extremely like it. It is one of a large family called the <em>umbelliferous</em>,
which contains both food, physic, and poison. It will be worth while for
you to know something about them, so let us examine this hemlock closely.
You see this tall hollow stalk, which divides into several branches, from
each of which spring spokes or <em>rundles</em>, as they are called, of flower-stalks.
You see they are like rays from a circle, or the spokes of a wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Or like the sticks of an umbrella.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True; and they are called <em>umbels</em>, which has the same derivation.
If you pursue one of these rundles or umbels, you will find that each stick
or spoke terminates in another set of smaller stalks, each of which bears
a single small flower.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> They are small ones, indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> But if you look sharply, I dare say your eyes are good enough to
distinguish that they are divided into five leaves, and furnished with five
chives and two pistils in the middle.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I can see them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> And so can I.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The pistils are succeeded by a sort of fruit, which is a twin-seed
joined in the middle, as you may see in this rundle that is past flowering.
Here I divide one of them into two.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Would each of these grow?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. Well, this is the structure of the flowering part of the
umbelliferous tribe. Now for the leaf. Pluck one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Is this one leaf, or many?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is properly one, but it is cut and divided into many portions.
From this mid-rib spring smaller leaves set opposite each other; and from
the rib of each of these proceed others, which themselves are also divided.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>These are called doubly or trebly pinnated leaves; and most of the
umbelliferous plants, but not all, have leaves of this kind.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> It is like a parsley-leaf.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True—and parsley is one of the same tribe, and hemlock and
others are sometimes mistaken for it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> How curiously the stalk of this hemlock is spotted!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. That is one of the marks by which it is known. It is also
distinguished by its peculiar smell, and by other circumstances which you
can only understand when you have compared a number of the tribe. I
will now tell you about some others, the names of which you are probably
acquainted with. In the first place, there are carrots and parsnips.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Carrots and parsnips!—they are not poisons, I am sure.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I remember, now, that carrots have such a leaf as this.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They have. It is the <em>roots</em> of these, you know, that are eaten.
But we eat the <em>leaves</em> of parsley and fennel, which are of the same class.
Celery is another, the <em>stalks</em> of which are chiefly used, made white by
trenching up the earth about them. The stalks of angelica are used
differently.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I know how—candied.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. Then there are many of which the <em>seeds</em> are used. There
is caraway.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What, the seeds that are put into cakes and comfits?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. They are warm and pungent to the taste; and so are the
seeds of many others of the umbelliferous plants, as coriander, fennel,
wild carrot, angelica, anise, cummin, and dill. All these are employed
in food or medicine, and are good in warming or strengthening the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Those are pleasant medicines enough.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are; but you will not say the same of some others of the
class, which are noted medicines too; such as the plant yielding asafœtida,
and several more, from which what are called the fetid gums are produced.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Asafœtida!—that’s nasty stuff, I know; does it grow here?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No; and most of the sweet seeds I before mentioned come from
abroad too. Now I will tell you of some of the poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Hemlock is one that we know already.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. Then there is another kind that grows in the water, and is
more poisonous, called water-hemlock. Another is a large plant growing
in ditches, with leaves extremely like celery, called hemlock-dropwort.
Another, common in drier situations, and distinguished by leaves less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>divided than most of the class, is cow-parsnip, or madnep. Of some of
these the leaves, of others the root, is most poisonous. Their effects are
to make the head giddy, bring on stupidity or delirium, and cause violent
sickness. The Athenians used to put criminals to death by making them
drink the juice of a kind of hemlock growing in that country, as you may
read in the life of that excellent philosopher, Socrates, who was killed in
that manner.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What was he killed for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Because he was wiser and better than his fellow-citizens. Among
us it is only by accident that mischief is done by these plants. I remember
a melancholy instance of a poor boy, who, in rambling about the fields
with his little brothers and sisters, chanced to meet with a root of hemlock-dropwort.
It looked so white and nice, that he was tempted to eat a good
deal of it. The other children also ate some, but not so much. When
they got home they were all taken very ill. The eldest boy, who had
eaten most, died in great agony. The others recovered, after suffering a
great deal.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is there any way of preventing their bad effects?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The best way is to clear the stomach as soon as possible by a
strong vomit and large draughts of warm water. After that, vinegar is
useful in removing the disorder of the head.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But are the roots sweet and pleasant, that people should be tempted
to eat them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Several of them are. There is a small plant of the tribe, the root
of which is much sought after by boys, who dig for it with their knives
It is round, and called earth-nut, or pig-nut.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But that’s not poison, I suppose?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No; but it is not very wholesome. I believe, however, that the
roots of the most poisonous become innocent by boiling. I have heard
that boiled hemlock roots are as good as carrots.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think I should not like to eat them, however. But pray, why
should there be any poisons at all?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> What we call poisons, are only hurtful to particular animals.
They are the proper food of others, and no doubt do more good than hurt
in the creation. Most of the things that are poisonous to us in large
quantities, are useful medicines in small ones; and we have reason
bestowed upon <em>us</em>, to guard us against mischief. Other animals, in general,
refuse by instinct what would prove hurtful to them. You see beneath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>yonder hedge a great crop of tall flourishing plants with white flowers.
They are of the umbelliferous family, and are called wild cicely, or cow-weed.
The latter name is given them, because the cows will not touch
them, though the pasture be ever so bare.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Would they poison them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Perhaps they would: at least they are not proper food for them.
We will go and examine them, and I will show you how they differ from
hemlock, for which they are sometimes mistaken.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I should like to get some of these plants, and dry them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> You shall, and write down the names of them all, and learn to
know the innocent from the hurtful.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> That will be very useful.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It will. Remember now the general character of the umbelliferous
plants. The flower-stalks are divided into spokes or umbels, which are
again divided into others, each of them terminated by a small, five-leaved
flower, having five chives and two pistils, succeeded by a twin-seed.
Their leaves are generally finely divided. You will soon know them,
after having examined two or three of the tribe. Remember, too, that
they are a <em>suspicious race</em>, and not to be made free with till you are well
acquainted with them.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>HUMBLE LIFE; OR, THE COTTAGERS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>(<em>Mr. Everard and Charles, walking in the fields.</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Mr. Everard.</em> Well, Charles, you seem to be in deep meditation.
Pray, what are you thinking about?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Charles.</em> I was thinking, sir, how happy it is for us that we are not in
the place of that poor weaver whose cottage we just passed by.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> It is very right to be sensible of all the advantages that
Providence has bestowed upon us in this world, and I commend you for
reflecting on them with gratitude. But what particular circumstance of
comparison between our condition and his struck you most just now?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> O, almost everything! I could not bear to live in such a poor
house, with a cold clay floor, and half the windows stopped with paper.
Then how poorly he and his children are dressed! and I dare say they
must live as poorly too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> These things would be grievous enough to you, I do not doubt,
because you have been accustomed to a very different way of living. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>if they are healthy and contented, I don’t know that we have much
more to boast of. I believe the man is able to procure wholesome food
for his family, and clothes and firing enough to keep them from suffering
from the cold; and nature wants little more.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But, what a ragged, barefooted fellow the boy at the door was!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> He was—but did you observe his ruddy cheeks, and his stout
legs, and the smiling grin upon his countenance? It is my opinion he
would beat you in running, though he is half the head less; and I dare
say he never cried because he did not know what to do with himself, in
his life.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But, sir, you have often told me that the mind is the noblest part
of man; and these poor creatures, I am sure, can have no opportunity to
improve their minds. They must be as ignorant as the brutes, almost.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> Why so? Do you think there is no knowledge to be got but
from books; or that a weaver cannot teach his children right from wrong?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Not if he has never learned himself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> True—but I hope the country we live in is not so unfriendly
to a poor man, as to afford him no opportunity of learning his duty to God
and his neighbour. And as to other points of knowledge, necessity and
common observation will teach him a good deal. But come—let us go
and pay him a visit, for I doubt you hardly think them human creatures.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> Good morning to you, friend! Don’t let us disturb you all,
pray. We have just stepped in to look at your work.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jacob.</em> I have very little to show you, gentlemen; but you are welcome
to look on. Perhaps the young gentleman never saw weaving before.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I never did, near.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> Look here, then, master. These long threads are the warp. They
are divided, you see, into two sets, and I pass my shuttle between them,
which carries with it the cross threads, and that makes the weft. (<em>Explains
the whole to him.</em>)</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Dear! how curious! And is all cloth made this way, papa?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> Yes; only there are somewhat different contrivances for
different kinds of work. Well, how soon do you think you could learn to
weave like this honest man?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> O—not for a great while?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span><em>Mr. Ev.</em> But I suppose you could easily turn the wheel, and draw out
threads like that good woman?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Not without some practice, I fancy. But what is that boy doing?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> He is cutting pegs for the shoemakers, master.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> How quick he does them!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> It is but poor employment, but better than being idle. The first
lesson I teach my children is, that their hands were made to get their
bread with.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> And a very good lesson, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> What is this heap of twigs for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> Why, master, my biggest boy and girl have learned a little how
to make basket-work, so I have got them a few osiers to employ them at
leisure hours. That bird-cage is their making: and the back of that
chair in which their grandmother sits.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Is not that cleverly done, papa?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> It is, indeed. Here are several arts, you see, in this house,
which both you and I should be much puzzled to set about. But there
are some books, too, I perceive.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Here is a bible, and a testament, and a prayer-book, and a spelling
book, and a volume of the Gardener’s Dictionary.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> And how many of your family can read, my friend?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> All the children but the two youngest can read a little, sir; but
Meg, there, is the best scholar among us. She reads us a chapter in the
Testament every morning, and very well, too, though I say it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> Do you hear that, Charles?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> I do, sir. Here’s an almanac, too, against the wall; and here
are my favourite ballads of the Children in the Wood, and Chevy-chase.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> I let the children paste them up, sir, and a few more that have no
harm in them. There’s Hearts of Oak, and Rule Britannia, and Robin
Gray.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> A very good choice, indeed. I see you have a pretty garden
there behind the house.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> It is only a little spot, sir; but it serves for some amusement, and
use too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> What beautiful stocks and wall-flowers! We have none so fine
in our garden.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> Why, master, to say the truth, we are rather proud of them. I
have got a way of cultivating them, that I believe few besides myself are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>acquainted with; and on Sundays I have plenty of visiters to come and
admire them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Pray, what is this bush with narrow whitish leaves and blue
flowers?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> Don’t you know? It is rosemary.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Is it good for anything?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> We like the smell of it; and then the leaves, mixed with a little
balm, make pleasant tea, which we sometimes drink in the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Here are several more plants that I never saw before.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> Some of them are pot-herbs, that we put into our broth or porridge;
and others are physic herbs, for we cannot afford to go to a doctor for every
trifling ailment.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> But how do you learn the use of these things?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> Why, partly, master, from an old herbal that I have got; and
partly from my good mother and some old neighbours; for we poor people
are obliged to help one another as well as we can. If you were curious
about plants, I could go into the fields, and show you a great many that
we reckon very fine for several uses, though I suppose we don’t call them
by the proper names.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> You keep your garden very neat, friend, and seem to make the
most of every inch of ground.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> Why, sir, we have hands enough, and all of us like to be doing a
little in it when our in-doors work is over. I am in hopes soon to be
allowed a bit of land from the waste for a potato-ground, which will be a
great help to us. I shall then be able to keep a pig.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> I suppose, notwithstanding your industry, you live rather hardly
sometimes?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> To be sure, sir, we are somewhat pinched in dear times and hard
weather; but, thank God, I have constant work, and my children begin
to be some help to us, so that we fare better than some of our neighbours.
If I do but keep my health, I don’t fear but we shall make a shift to live.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> Keep such a contented mind, my friend, and you will have few
to envy. Good morning to you, and if any sickness or accident should
befall you, remember you have a friend in your neighbour at the hall.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> I will, sir, and thank you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Good morning to you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Jac.</em> The same to you, master.</p>
<div class='c017'>[<em>They leave the cottage.</em></div>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> Well, Charles, what do you think of our visit?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span><em>Ch.</em> I am highly pleased with it, sir. I shall have a better opinion of
a poor cottager as long as I live.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> I am glad of it. You see when we compare ourselves with
this weaver, all the advantage is not on our side. He is possessed of an
art, the utility of which secures him a livelihood, whatever may be the
changes of the times. All his family are brought up to industry, and
show no small ingenuity in their several occupations. They are not
without instruction, and especially seem to be in no want of that best of
all, the knowledge of their duty. They understand something of the
cultivation and uses of plants, and are capable of receiving enjoyment
from the beauties of nature. They partake of the pleasures of home and
neighbourhood. Above all they seem content with their lot, and free
from anxious cares and repinings. I view them as truly respectable
members of society, acting well the part allotted to them, and that, a part
most of all necessary to the well-being of the whole. They may, from
untoward accidents, be rendered objects of our compassion, but they never
can of our contempt.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> Indeed, sir, I am very far from despising them now. But would
it not be possible to make them more comfortable than they are at present?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> I think it would; and when giving a little from the superfluity
of persons in our situation would add so much to the happiness of persons
in theirs, I am of opinion that it is unpardonable not to do it. I intend to
use my interest to get this poor man the piece of waste land he wants,
and he shall have some from my share rather than go without.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> And suppose, sir, we were to give him some good potatoes to
plant it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> We will. Then, you know, we have a fine sow, that never
fails to produce a numerous litter twice a year. Suppose we rear one of
the next brood to be ready for him as soon as he has got his potato-ground
into bearing?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ch.</em> O yes! that will be just the thing. But how is he to build a
pigsty?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. Ev.</em> You may leave that to his own ingenuity! I warrant he can
manage such a job as that with the help of a neighbour, at least. Well—I
hope both the weaver, and you, will be the better for the acquaintance
we have made to-day; and always remember, that <em>man, when fulfilling
the duties of his station, be that station what it may, is a worthy object
of respect to his fellow-men</em>.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE BIRTHDAY GIFT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The populous kingdom of Ava, in India beyond the Ganges, was once
inherited by a minor prince, who was brought up in the luxurious indolence
of an eastern palace. When he had reached the age of seventeen, which
by the laws of that country, was the period of majority for the crown, all
the great men of his court, and the governors of the provinces, according
to established custom, laid at his feet presents consisting of the most
costly products of nature and art that they had been able to procure.
One offered a casket of the most precious jewels of Golconda; another a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>curious piece of clockwork made by a European artist; another, a piece
of the richest silk from the looms of China; another, a bezoar stone said
to be a sovereign antidote against all poisons and infectious diseases;
another, a choice piece of the most fragrant rose-wood, in a box of ebony
inlaid with pearls; another, a golden cruse full of genuine balsam of
Mecca; another, a courser of the purest breed of Arabia; and another, a
female slave of exquisite beauty. The whole court of the palace was
overspread with rarities; and long rows of slaves were continually passing
loaded with vessels and utensils of gold and silver, and other articles of
high price.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length, an aged magistrate from a distant province made his
appearance. He was simply clad in a long cotton robe, and his hoary
beard waved on his breast. He made his obeisance before the young
monarch, and holding forth an embroidered silken bag, he thus addressed
him:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Deign, great king, to accept the faithful homage and fervent good
wishes of thy servant on this important day, and with them the small
present I hold in my hand. Small, indeed, it is in show, but not so, I
trust, in value. Others have offered what may decorate thy person—here
is what will impart perpetual grace and lustre to thy features. Others
have presented thee with rich perfumes—here is what will make thy
name sweet and fragrant to the latest ages. Others have given what may
afford pleasure to thine eyes—here is what will nourish a source of
never-failing pleasure within thy breast. Others have furnished thee with
preservatives against bodily contagion—here is what will preserve thy
better parts uncontaminated. Others have heaped round thee the riches
of a temporal kingdom—this will secure thee the treasures of an eternal
one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He said, and drew from the purse a book, containing <em>the moral precepts
of the sage Zendar</em>, the wisest and most virtuous man the East had ever
beheld. “If,” he proceeded, “my gracious sovereign will condescend to
make this his constant companion, not an hour can pass in which its
perusal may not be a comfort and a blessing. In the arduous duties of
thy station it will prove a faithful guide and counsellor. Amid the
allurements of pleasure and the incitements of passion, it will be an
incorruptible monitor, that will never suffer thee to err without warning
thee of thy error. It will render thee a blessing to thy people, and blessed
in thyself: for what sovereign can be the one without the other?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>He then returned the book to its place, and kneeling, gave it into the
hands of the king. He received it with respect and benignity, and
history affirms that the use he made of it corresponded with the wishes
of the donor.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Tutor</em>—<em>George</em>—<em>Harry</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Harry.</em> I wonder what all this heap of stones is for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>George.</em> I can tell you—it is for the lime-kiln; do n’t you see it just by?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> O yes, I do. But what is to be done to them there?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Why, they are to be burnt into lime; do n’t you know that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But what is lime, and what are its uses?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I can tell you one; they lay it on the fields for manure. Do n’t
you remember we saw a number of little heaps of it, that we took for
sheep at a distance, and wondered they did not move? However, I
believe we had better ask our tutor about it. Will you please, sir, to tell
us something about lime?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tutor.</em> Willingly. But suppose, as we talked about all sorts of metals
some time ago, I should now give you a lecture about stones and earths of
all kinds, which are equally valuable, and much more common than metals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Pray, do, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I shall be very glad to hear it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well, then. In the first place, the ground we tread upon, to as
great a depth as it has been dug, consists for the most part of matter of
various appearance and hardness, called by the general name of <em>earths</em>.
In common language, indeed, only the soft and powdery substances are
so named, while the hard and solid are called <em>stone</em> or <em>rock</em>; but chymists
use the same term for all; as, in fact, earth is only crumbled stone, and
stone only consolidated earth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> What!—has the mould of my garden ever been stone?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The black earth or mould which covers the surface wherever
plants grow, consists mostly of parts of rotted vegetables, such as stalks,
leaves, and roots, mixed with sand or loose clay; but this only reaches a
little way; and beneath it you always come to a bed of gravel, or clay, or
stone of some kind. Now these earths and stones are distinguished into
several species, but principally into three, the properties of which make
them useful to man for very different purposes, and are, therefore, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>well worth knowing. As you began with asking me about lime, I shall
first mention that class of earths from which it is obtained. These have
derived their name of <em>calcareous</em> from this very circumstance, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">calx</span></i> being
lime, in Latin; and lime is got from them all in the same way, by burning
them in a strong fire. There are many kinds of calcareous earths. One
of them is <em>marble</em>; you know what that is?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> O yes! Our parlour chimney-piece and hearth are marble.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> And so are the monuments in the church.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. There are various kinds of it: white, black, yellow, gray,
mottled and veined with different colours; but all of them are hard and
heavy stones, admitting a fine polish, on which account they are much
used in ornamental works.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think statues are made of it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; and where it is plentiful, columns, and porticoes, and
sometimes whole buildings. Marble is the luxury of architecture.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Where does marble come from?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> From a great many countries. Great Britain produces some, but
mostly of inferior kinds. What we use chiefly comes from Italy. The
Greek islands yield some fine sorts. That of Paros is of ancient fame for
whiteness and purity, and the finest antique statues have been made of
Parian marble.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I suppose black marble will not burn into white lime?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, it will. A violent heat will expel most of the colouring
matter of marbles, and make them white. <em>Chalk</em> is another kind of
calcareous earth. This is of a much softer consistence than marble;
being easily cut with a knife, and marking things on which it is rubbed.
It is found in great beds in the earth; and in some parts of England
whole hills are composed of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Are chalk and whiting the same?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Whiting is made of the finer and purer particles of chalk washed
out from the rest, and then dried in lumps. This you know is quite soft
and crumbly. There are, besides, a great variety of stones in the earth
harder than chalk, but softer than marble, which will burn to lime, and are
therefore called <em>lime-stones</em>. These differ much in colour and other properties,
and accordingly furnish lime of different qualities. Whole ridges of
mountains in various parts are composed of lime-stone, and it is found
plentifully in most of the hilly counties of England, to the great advantage
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span><em>Geo.</em> Will not oyster-shells burn into lime? I think I have heard of
oyster-shell lime.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They will, and this is another source of calcareous earth. The
shells of all animals, both land and sea, as oysters, mussels, cockles, crabs,
lobsters, snails, and the like, and also egg-shells of all kinds, consist of
this earth; and so does coral, which is formed by insects under the sea,
and is very abundant in some countries. Vast quantities of shells are
often found deep in the earth, in the midst of chalk and lime-stone beds;
whence some have supposed that all calcareous earth is originally an
animal production.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But where could animals enough ever have lived to make mountains
of their shells?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That, indeed, I cannot answer. But there are sufficient proofs
that our world must long have existed in a very different state from the
present. Well—but besides these purer calcareous earths, it is very
frequently found mingled in different proportions with other earths. Thus
<em>marl</em>, which is so much used in manuring land, and of which there are a
great many kinds, consists of calcareous earth, united with clay and sand;
and the more of this earth it contains, the richer manure it generally makes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is there any way of discovering it when it is mixed in this manner
with other things?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—there is an easy and sure method of discovering the smallest
portion of it. All the varieties of calcareous earth that I have mentioned
have the property of dissolving in acids, and effervescing with them; that
is, they bubble and hiss when acids are poured upon them. You may
readily try this at any time with a piece of chalk or an oyster-shell.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I will pour some vinegar upon an oyster-shell as soon as I get
home. But now I think of it, I have often done so in eating oysters, and
I never observed it to hiss or bubble.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Vinegar is not an acid strong enough to act upon a thing so solid
as a shell. But sulphuric and muriatic acids will do it at once; and
persons who examine the nature of fossils always travel with a bottle of
one of these acids, by way of a test of calcareous earth. Your vinegar
will answer with chalk or whiting. This property of dissolving in acids,
and what is called neutralizing them, or taking away their sourness, has
caused many of the calcareous earths to be used in medicine. You know
that sometimes our food turns very sour upon the stomach, and occasions
the pain called heart-burn, and other uneasy symptoms. In these cases it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>is common to give chalk or powdered shells, or other things of this kind,
which afford relief, by neutralizing the acid.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I suppose, then, <em>magnesia</em> is something of this sort, for I have
often seen it given to my little sister, when they said her stomach was out
of order?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is; but though magnesia has some properties in common with
calcareous earths, it possesses others that are peculiar to itself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Pray, what are the other uses of these earths?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Such of them as are hard stone, as the marbles and many of the
lime-stones, are used for the same purposes as other stones. But their
great use is in the form of lime, which is a substance of many curious
properties that I will now explain to you. When fresh burnt it is called
<em>quicklime</em>, on account of the heat and life, as it were, which it possesses.
Have you ever seen a lump put into water?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes, I have.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Were you not much surprised to see it swell and crack to pieces,
with a hissing noise and a great smoke and heat?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I was, indeed. But what is the cause of this—how can cold
water occasion so much heat?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I will tell you. The strong heat to which calcareous earth is
exposed in making it lime expels all the water it contained, (for all earths,
as well as almost everything else, naturally contain water,) and also a
quantity of a peculiar kind of air which was united with it. If water be
now added to this quicklime, it is drunk in again with such rapidity, as to
crack and break the lime to pieces. At the same time a great heat is
occasioned by the water combining with the lime, and this makes itself
sensible by its effects, burning all the things that it touches, and turning
part of the water to steam. This operation is called slacking of lime.
The water in which lime is slacked dissolves a part of it, and acquires a
very pungent harsh taste: this is used in medicine under the name of
lime-water. If instead of soaking quicklime in water, it is exposed for
sometime to the air, it attracts moisture slowly, and by degrees fails to
powder, without much heat or disturbance. But whether lime be slacked
in water or air, it does not at first return to the state in which it was before,
since it still remains deprived of its air, and on that account is still pungent
and caustic. At length, however, it recovers this also from the atmosphere,
and is then mild calcareous earth as at first. Now it is upon some of these
circumstances that the utility of lime depends. In the first place, its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>burning and corroding quality makes it useful to the tanner, in loosening
all the hair from the hides, and destroying the flesh and fat that adhered
to them. And so in various other trades it is used as a great cleanser and
purifier.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I have a thought come into my head. When it is laid upon the
ground, I suppose its use must be to burn up the weeds?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True—that is part of its use.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But it must burn up the good grass and corn too?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Properly objected. But the case is, that the farmer does not sow
his seeds till the lime is rendered mild by exposure to the air and weather,
and is well mixed with the soil. And even then it is reckoned a hot and
forcing manure, chiefly fit for cold and wet lands. The principal use of
lime, however, is as an ingredient in <em>mortar</em>. This, you know, is the
cement by which bricks and stones are held together in building. It is
made of fresh slacked lime and a proportion of sand well mixed together;
and, when used for plastering walls, some chopped hair is put into it.
The lime binds with the other ingredients; and in length of time, the
mortar, if well made, becomes as hard, or harder, than stone itself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have heard of the mortar in very old buildings being harder and
stronger than any made at present.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is only on account of its age. Burning lime and making
mortar are as well understood now as ever: but in order to have it excellent,
the lime should be of a good quality, and thoroughly burnt. Some sorts
of lime have the property of making mortar which will harden under
water, whence it is much valued for bridges, locks, wharfs, and the like.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Pray, is not plaster of Paris a kind of lime? I know it will
become hard by only mixing water with it, for I have used it to make
casts of.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The powder you call plaster of Paris is made of an earth named
<em>gypsum</em>, of which there are several kinds. <em>Alabaster</em> is a stone of this
sort, and hard enough to be used like marble. The gypseous earths are
of the calcareous kind, but they have naturally a portion of acid united
with them, whence they will not effervesce on having acid poured on them.
But they are distinguished by the property, that after being calcined or
burnt in the fire, and reduced to powder, they will set into a solid body
by the addition of water alone. This makes them very useful for ornamental
plasters, that are to receive a form or impression, such as the stucco
for the ceiling of rooms.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Well—we have said enough about calcareous earths; now to another
class, the <em>argillaceous</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think I know what those are. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Argilla</span></i> is <em>Latin</em> for <em>clay</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True; and they are also called <em>clayey</em> earths. In general, these
earths are of a soft texture and a sort of greasy feel; but they are peculiarly
distinguished by the property of becoming sticky on being tempered
with water, so that they may be drawn out and worked into form like a
paste. Have you ever, when you were a little boy, made a clay-house?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes, I have.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Then you well know the manner in which clay is tempered, and
worked for this purpose?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes—and I remember helping to make little pots and mugs of
clay.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Then you imitated the potter’s trade; for all utensils of earthenware
are made of clays either pure or mixed. This is one of the oldest
arts among mankind, and one of the most useful. They furnish materials
for building, too; for bricks and tiles are made of these earths. But in
order to be fit for these purposes, it is necessary that clay should not only
be soft and ductile while it is forming, but capable of being hardened
afterward; and this it is, by the assistance of fire. Pottery-ware and
bricks are burnt with a strong heat in kilns, by which they acquire a
hardness equal to that of the hardest stone.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think I have heard of bricks being baked by the sun’s heat alone
in very hot countries.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True; and they may serve for building in climates where rain
scarcely ever falls; but heavy showers would wash them away. Fire
seems to change the nature of clays; for after they have undergone its
operation, they become incapable of returning of themselves to a soft and
ductile state. You might steep brick-dust or pounded pots in water ever
so long without making it hold together in the least.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I suppose there are many kinds of clays?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> There are. Argillaceous earths differ greatly from each other in
colour, purity, and other qualities. Some are perfectly white, as that of
which tobacco-pipes are made. Others are blue, brown, yellow, and in
short of all hues, which they owe to mixtures of decaying vegetable substances
or metals. Those which burn red contain a portion of iron. No
clays are found perfectly pure; but they are mixed with more or less of
other earths. The common brick-clays contain a large proportion of sand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>which often makes them crumbly and perishable. In general, the finest
earthenware is made of the purest and whitest clays; but other matters
are mixed in order to harden and strengthen them. Thus <em>porcelain</em> or
<em>china</em> is made with a clayey earth mixed with a stone of vitrifiable nature,
that is, which may be melted into glass; and the fine pottery called
<em>queen’s ware</em> is a mixture of tobacco-pipe clay, and flints burnt and
powdered. Common stone <em>ware</em> is a coarse mixture of this sort. Some
species of pottery are made with mixtures of burnt and unburnt clay;
the former I told you before, being incapable of becoming soft again with
water like a natural clay.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Are clays of no other use than to make pottery of?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, the richest soils are those which have a proportion of clay;
and marl, which I have already mentioned as a manure, generally contains
a good deal of it. Then clay has the property of absorbing oil or
grease, whence some kinds of it are used like soap for cleaning clothes.
The substance called <em>fullers’ earth</em> is a mixed earth of the argillaceous
kind; and its use in taking out the oil which naturally adheres to wool
is so great, that it has been one cause of the superiority of our woollen
cloths.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Then I suppose it is found in England?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes. There are pits of the best kind of it near Woburn in Bedfordshire,
and Nutfield in Surrey, England. The different kinds of slate,
too, are stones of the argillaceous class; and very useful ones, for covering
houses, and other purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Are writing slates like the slates used for covering houses?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; but their superior blackness and smoothness make them
show better the marks of the pencil.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> You have mentioned something of sand and flints, but you have
not told us what sort of earths they are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I reserved that till I spoke of the third great class of earths. This
is the <em>siliceous</em> class, so named from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">silex</span></i>, which is Latin for a flint-stone.
They have also been called <em>vitrifiable</em> earths, because they are the principal
ingredient in glass, named in Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitrum</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have heard of flint-glass.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—but neither flint, nor any other of the kind, will make glass,
even by the strongest heat, without some addition; but this we will speak
of by-and-by. I shall now tell you the principal properties of these earths.
They are all very hard, and will strike fire with steel, when in a mass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>large enough for the stroke. They mostly run into particular shapes, with
sharp angles and points, and have a certain degree of transparency, which
has made them also be called <em>crystalline</em> earths. They do not in the
least soften with water, like clays; nor are they affected by acids, nor do
they burn to lime, like the calcareous earths. As to the different kinds of
them, <em>flint</em> has already been mentioned. It is a very common production
in some parts, and is generally met with in pebbles, or round lumps forming
pebbles, in gravel-beds, and often almost entirely covering the surface
of ploughed fields.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But do they not hinder the corn from growing?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The corn, to be sure, cannot take root upon them, but I believe it
has been found that the protection they afford to the young plants which
grow under them is more than equal to the harm they do by taking up
room. Flints are also frequently found imbedded in chalk under the
ground. Those used in the Staffordshire potteries chiefly come from
the chalk-pits near Gravesend. So much for flints. You have seen
white pebbles, which are semi-transparent, and when broken resemble
white sugar-candy. They are common on the seashore, and beds of
rivers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> O, yes. We call them fire-stones. When they are rubbed
together in the dark they send out great flashes of light, and have a
particular smell.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. The proper name of these is <em>quartz</em>. It is found in large
quantities in the earth, and the ores of metals are often imbedded in it.
Sometimes it is perfectly transparent, and then it is called <em>crystal</em>. Some
of these crystals shoot into exact mathematical figures; and because many
salts do the same, and are also transparent, they are called the <em>crystals</em> of
such or such a salt.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Is not fine glass called crystal, too?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is called so by way of simile; thus we say of a thing, “It is
as clear as a crystal.” But the only true crystal is an earth of the kind
I have been describing. Well, now we come to <em>sand</em>; for this is properly
only quartz in a powdery state. If you examine the grains of sand singly,
or look at them with a magnifying glass, you will find them all either
entirely or partly transparent; and in some of the white shining sands
the grains are all little bright crystals.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But most sand is broken or yellowish.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is owing to some mixture generally of the metallic kind. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>believe I once told you that all sands were supposed to contain a small
portion of gold. It is more certain that many of them contain iron.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But what could have brought this quartz and crystal into powder,
so as to have produced all the sand in the world?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> That is not very easy to determine. On the seashore, however,
the incessant rolling of the pebbles by the waves is enough in time to
grind them to powder; and there is reason to believe that the greatest
part of what is now dry land was once sea, which may account for the
vast beds of sand met with inland.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I have seen some stone so soft that one might crumble it between
one’s fingers, and then it seemed to turn to sand.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> There are several of this kind, more or less solid, which are
chiefly composed of sand conglutinated by some natural cement. Such
are called <em>sandstone</em>, or <em>freestone</em>, and are used for various purposes, in
building, making grindstones, and the like, according to their hardness.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Pray, what are the common pebbles that the streets are paved
with? I am sure they strike fire enough with horses’ shoes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are stones of the siliceous kind, either pure or mixed with
other earths. One of the hardest and best for this purpose is called
<em>granite</em>, which is of various kinds and colours, but always consists of
grains of different siliceous stones cemented together. The streets of
London are paved with granite brought from Scotland. In some other
stones these bits of different earths dispersed through the cement are so
large as to look like plums in a pudding; whence they have obtained the
name of <em>pudding-stones</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think there is a kind of stones that you have not yet mentioned—precious
stones.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> These, too, are mostly siliceous; but some even of the hardest
and most valuable are argillaceous in their nature, though possessing none
of the external properties of clay. The opaque and half-transparent
precious stones, such as jasper, agate, cornelian, and lapis lazuli, are
engraved upon for seal-stones; the more beautiful and transparent ones,
as ruby, emerald, sapphire, topaz, which go by the name of gems, are
generally only cut and polished, and worn in rings, ear-rings, necklaces,
and the like.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Diamond, no doubt, is one of them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> So it has commonly been reckoned, and the purest of all; but late
experiments have shown, that though it is the hardest body in nature it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>may be totally dispersed into vapour by a strong fire, so that mineralogists
will now hardly allow it to be a stone at all, but class it among inflammable
substances. The precious stones abovementioned owe their
colours chiefly to some metallic mixture. They are in general extremely
hard, so as to cut glass, and one another; but diamonds will cut all the
rest.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But are they not exceedingly rare?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes; and in this rarity consists the greatest part of their value.
They are, indeed, beautiful objects; but the figure they make in proportion
to their expense is so very small, that their high price may be reckoned
one of the principal follies among mankind. What proportion can there
possibly be between the real worth of a glittering stone as big as a hazelnut,
and a magnificent house and gardens, or a large tract of country
covered with noble woods and rich meadows and cornfields? And as to
the mere glitter, a large lustre of cut glass has an infinitely greater effect
on the eye than all the jewels of a foreign prince.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Will you please to tell us how glass is made?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Willingly. The base of it is, as I said before, some earth of the
siliceous class. Those commonly used are flint and sand. Flint is first
burnt or calcined, which makes it quite white, like enamel; and it is then
powdered. This is the material sometimes used for some very white
glasses; but sand is that commonly preferred, as being already in a
powdery form. The white crystalline sands are used for fine glass; the
brown or yellow for the common sort. As these earths will not melt of
themselves, the addition in making glass is somewhat that promotes their
fusion. Various things will do this; but what is generally used is an
alkaline salt, obtained from the ashes of burnt vegetables. Of this there
are several kinds, as potash, pearlash, barilla, and kelp. The salt is mixed
with the sand in a certain proportion, and the mixture then exposed in
earthen pots to a violent heat, till it is thoroughly melted. The mass is
then cooled till it is nearly of the consistence of dough, and in this state
it is fashioned by blowing and the use of shears and other instruments.
You must see this done some time, for it is one of the most curious and
pleasing of all manufactures; and it is not possible to form an idea of the
ease and dexterity with which glass is wrought, without an actual view.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I should like very much to see it, indeed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Where is glass made in this country?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> In many places. Some of the finest in London, but the coarser
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>kinds generally where coals are cheap; as at Newcastle and its neighbourhood,
in Lancashire, at Stourbridge, Bristol, and in South Wales. I
should have told you, however, that in our finest and most brilliant glass,
a quantity of the oxide of lead is put, which vitrifies with the other
ingredients, and gives the glass more firmness and density. The blue,
yellow, and red glasses are coloured with the oxides of other metals. As
to the common green glass, it is made with an alkali that has a good deal
of calcareous earth remaining with the ashes of the plant. But to understand
all the different circumstances of glassmaking, one must have a
thorough knowledge of chymistry.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think making of glass is one of the finest inventions of human
skill.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is perhaps not of that capital importance that some other arts
possess; but it has been a great addition to the comfort and pleasure of
life in many ways. Nothing makes such clean and agreeable vessels as
glass, which has the quality of not being corroded by any kind of liquor,
as well as that of showing its contents by its transparency. Hence it is
greatly preferable to the most precious metals for drinking out of; and
for the same reasons it is preferred to every other material for chymical
utensils, where the heat to be employed is not strong enough to melt it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Then glass windows.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Ay; that is a very material comfort in a climate like ours, where
we so often wish to let in the light, and keep out the cold wind and rain.
What could be more gloomy than to sit in the dark, or with no other
light than came in through small holes covered with oiled paper or bladder
unable to see anything passing without doors! Yet this must have been
the case with the most sumptuous palaces before the invention of window-glass,
which was a good deal later than that of bottles and drinking-glasses.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> I think looking-glasses are very beautiful.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are, indeed, very elegant pieces of furniture, and very costly
too. The art of casting glass into large plates, big enough to reach almost
from the bottom to the top of a room, is but lately introduced into this
country from France. But the most splendid and brilliant manner of
employing glass is in lustres and chandeliers, hung around with drops cut
so as to reflect the light with all the colours of the rainbow. Some of the
shops in London, filled with these articles, appear to realize all the
wonders of an enchanted palace in the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span><em>Geo.</em> But are not spectacles and spying-glasses more useful than all
these?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I did not mean to pass them over, I assure you. By the curious
invention of optical glasses of various kinds, not only the natural defects
of the sight have been remedied, and old age has been in some measure
lightened of one of its calamities, but the sense of seeing has been wonderfully
extended. The telescope has brought distant objects within our
view, while the microscope has given us a clear survey of near objects too
minute for our unassisted eyes. By means of both, some of the brightest
discoveries of the modern times have been made; so that glass has proved
not less admirable in promoting science than in contributing to splendour
and convenience. Well—I don’t know that I have anything more at
present to say relative to the class of earths. We have gone through the
principal circumstances belonging to their three great divisions, the
<em>calcareous</em>, <em>argillaceous</em>, and <em>siliceous</em>. You will remember, however,
that most of the earths and stones offered by nature are not in any one
of these kinds perfectly pure, but contain a mixture of one or both the
others. There is not a pebble that you can pick up, which would not
exercise the skill of a mineralogist fully to ascertain its properties, and
the materials of its composition. So inexhaustible is nature!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>SHOW AND USE; OR, THE TWO PRESENTS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>One morning, Lord Richmore, coming down to breakfast, was welcomed
with the tidings that his favourite mare, Miss Slim, had brought a foal,
and also, that a she-ass, kept for his lady’s use as a milker, had dropped
a young one. His lordship smiled at the inequality of the presents nature
had made him. “As for the foal,” said he to the groom, “that, you know,
has been long promised to my neighbour, Mr. Scamper. For young
Balaam, you may dispose of him as you please.” The groom thanked
his lordship, and said he would then give him to Isaac the woodman.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>In due time, Miss Slim’s foal, which was the son of a noted racer, was
taken to Squire Scamper’s, who received him with great delight, and out
of compliment to the donor, named him <em>Young Peer</em>. He was brought
up with at least as much care and tenderness as the Squire’s own children—kept
in a warm stable, fed with the best of corn and hay, duly dressed
and regularly exercised. As he grew up, he gave tokens of great beauty.
His colour was bright bay, with a white star on his forehead; his coat was
fine, and shone like silk; and every point about him seemed to promise
perfection of shape and make. Everybody admired him as the completest
colt that could be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>So fine a creature could not be destined to any useful employment.
After he had passed his third year, he was sent to Newmarket to be
trained for the turf, and a groom was appointed to the care of him alone.
His master, who could not well afford the expense, saved part of it by
turning off a domestic tutor whom he kept for the education of his sons,
and was content with sending them to the curate of the parish.</p>

<p class='c000'>At four years old, Young Peer started for a subscription purse, and
came in second out of a number of competitors. Soon after, he won a
country plate, and filled his master with joy and triumph. The Squire
now turned all his attention to the turf, made matches, betted high, and
was at first tolerably successful. At length, having ventured all the
money he could raise upon one grand match, Young Peer ran on the
wrong side of the post, was distanced, and the Squire ruined.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meantime, young Balaam went into Isaac’s possession, where he had a
very different training. He was left to pick up his living as he could in
the lanes and commons; and on the coldest days in winter he had no
other shelter than the lee-side of the cottage, out of which he was often
glad to pluck the thatch for a subsistence. As soon as ever he was able
to bear a rider, Isaac’s children got upon him, sometimes two or three at
once; and if he did not go to their mind, a broomstick or bunch of furze
was freely applied to his hide. Nevertheless, he grew up, as the children
themselves did, strong and healthy; and though he was rather bare on
the ribs, his shape was good, and his limbs vigorous.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not long before his master thought of putting him to some use;
so taking him to the wood, he fastened a load of fagots on his back, and
sent him with his son Tom to the next town. Tom sold the fagots, and
mounting upon Balaam, rode him home. As Isaac could get plenty of fagots
and chips, he found it a profitable trade to send them for daily sale upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Balaam’s back. Having a little garden, which, from the barrenness of
the soil, yielded him nothing of value, he bethought him of loading
Balaam back from town with dung for manure. Though all he could
bring at once was contained in two small panniers, yet this in time
amounted to enough to mend the soil of his whole garden, so that he grew
very good cabbages and potatoes, to the great relief of his family. Isaac
being now sensible of the value of his ass, began to treat him with more
attention. He got a small stack of rushy hay for his winter fodder, and
with his own hands built him a little shed of boughs and mud, in order
to shelter him from the bad weather. He would not suffer any of his
family to use Balaam ill, and after his daily journeys he was allowed to
ramble at pleasure. He was now and then cleaned and dressed, and
upon the whole made a reputable figure. Isaac took in more land from the
waste, so that by degrees he became a little farmer, and kept a horse and
cart, a cow, and two or three pigs. This made him quite a rich man, but
he had always the gratitude to impute his prosperity to the good services
of Balaam, the groom’s present; while the Squire cursed Young Peer as
the cause of his ruin, and many a time wished that his lordship had kept
his dainty gift to himself.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE CRUCIFORM-FLOWERED PLANTS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Tutor</em>—<em>George</em>—<em>Harry.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>George.</em> How rich yon field looks with its yellow flowers! I wonder
what they can be?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tutor.</em> Suppose you go and see if you can find it out; and bring a stalk
of the flowers with you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> (<em>Returning</em>). I know now—they are turnips.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> I thought you could make it out when you came near them.
These turnips are left to seed, which is the reason why you see them run
to flower. Commonly they are pulled up sooner.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harry.</em> I should not have thought a turnip had so sweet a flower.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think I have smelt others like them. Pray, sir, what class of
plants do they belong to?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> To a very numerous one, with which it is worth your while to
get acquainted. Let us sit down and examine them. The petal, you
observe, consists of four flat leaves set opposite to each other, or crosswise.
From this circumstance the flowers have been called <em>cruciform</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>As most plants with flowers of this kind bear their seeds in pods, they
have likewise been called the <em>siliquose</em> plants, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">siliqua</span></i> being the Latin
for a pod.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But the papilionaceous flowers bear pods, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True; and therefore the name is not a good one. Now pull off
the petals one by one. You see they are fastened by long claws within
the flower cup. Now count the chives.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> There are six.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> But they are not all of the same length—two are much shorter
than the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Well observed. It is from this that Linnæus has formed a
particular class for the whole tribe, which he calls <em>tetradynamia</em>, a word
implying <em>four powers</em>, or the <em>power of four</em>, as if the four longer chives
were more perfect and efficacious than the two shorter; which, however,
we do not know to be the case. This superior length of four chives is
conspicuous in most plants of this tribe, but not in all. They have, however,
other resemblances which are sufficient to constitute them a natural
family; and accordingly all botanists have made them such.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flowers, as I have said, have in all of them four petals placed
crosswise. The calyx also consists of four oblong and hollow leaves.
There is a single pistil, standing upon a seed-bud, which, turns either
into a long pod, or a short round one called a pouch; and hence are
formed the two great branches of the family, the podded and the pouched.
The seed-vessel has two valves, or external openings, with a partition
between. The seeds are small and roundish, attached alternately to
both sutures or joinings of the valves. Do you observe all these circumstances?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo. and Har.</em> We do.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> You shall examine them more minutely in a larger plant of the
kind. Further, almost all these plants have somewhat of a biting taste,
and also a disagreeable smell in their leaves, especially when decayed.
A turnip-field, you know, smells but indifferently; and cabbage, which is
one of this class, is apt to be remarkably offensive.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Yes, there is nothing worse than rotten cabbage-leaves.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> And the very water in which they are boiled is enough to scent a
whole house.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The flowers, however, of almost all the family are fragrant, and
some remarkably so. What do you think of wall-flowers, and stocks?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span><em>Har.</em> What, are they of this kind?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes—and so is candy-tuft, and rocket.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Then they are not to be despised.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> No—and especially as not one of the whole class, I believe, is
poisonous; but, on the contrary, many of them afford good food for man
and beast. Shall I tell you about the principal of them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Pray do, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The pungency of taste which so many of them possess has caused
them to be used for salad herbs. Thus we have cress, water-cress, and
mustard; to which might be added many more which grow wild, as lady-smock,
wild-rocket, hedge-mustard, and jack-by-the-hedge, or sauce-alone.
Mustard, you know, is also greatly used for its seeds, the powder or flower
of which, made into a sort of paste with salt and water, is eaten with
many kinds of meat. Rape-seeds are very similar to them, and from both
an oil is pressed out, of the mild or tasteless kind, as it is likewise from
cole-seed, another product of this class. Scurvy-grass, which is a pungent
plant of this family, growing by the seaside, has obtained its name from
being a remedy for the scurvy. Then there is horseradish, with the root
of which I am sure you are well acquainted, as a companion to roast beef.
Common radish, too, is a plant of this kind, which has a good deal of
pungency. One sort of it has a root like a turnip, which brings it near in
quality to the turnip itself. This last plant, though affording a sweet and
mild nutriment, has naturally a degree of pungency and rankness.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> That, I suppose, is the reason why turnipy milk and butter have
such a strong taste?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Then why do they feed cows with it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> In this case as in many others, quality is sacrificed to quantity.
But the better use of the turnip to the farmer is to fatten sheep and cattle.
By its assistance he is enabled to keep many more of these animals than
he could find grass or hay for; and the culture of turnips prepares his land
for grain as well, or better, than could be done by letting it lie quite fallow.
Turnip husbandry, as it is called, is one of the capital modern improvements
of agriculture.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I think I have heard that Norfolk is famous for it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> It is so. That county abounds in light sandy lands, which are
peculiarly suitable to turnips. But they are now grown in many parts
of England besides. Well—but we must say something more about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>cabbage, an article of food of very long standing. The original species
of this is a seaside plant, but cultivation has produced a great number of
varieties well known in our gardens, as white and red cabbage, kale,
colewort, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brocoli</span>, borecole, and cauliflower.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> But the flower of cauliflower does not seem at all like that of
cabbage or turnip.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> The white head, called its flower, is not properly so, but consists
of a cluster of imperfect buds. If they are left to grow for seed, they
throw out some spikes of yellow flowers like common cabbage. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Brocoli</span>
heads are of the same kind. As to the head of white or red cabbage, it
consists of a vast number of leaves closing round each other, by which
the innermost are prevented from expanding, and remain white on account
of the exclusion of the light and air. This part, you know, is most valued
for food. In some countries they cut cabbage-heads into quarters, and
make them undergo a kind of acid fermentation; after which they are
salted and preserved for winter food, under the name of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">sour-krout</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Cattle, too, are sometimes fed with cabbage, I believe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Yes, and large fields of them are cultivated for that purpose.
They succeed best in stiff clayey soils, where they sometimes grow to an
enormous bigness. They are given to milch kine as well as to fattening
cattle.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Do not they give a bad taste to the milk?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are apt to do so unless great care is taken to pick off all the
decayed leaves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coleworts, which are a smaller sort of cabbage, are sometimes grown
for feeding sheep and cattle. I think I have now mentioned most of the
useful plants of this family, which you see are numerous and important.
They both yield beef and mutton, and the sauce to them. But many of
the species are troublesome weeds. You see how yonder corn is overrun
with yellow flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> Yes: they are as thick as if they had been sown.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are of this family, and called charlock, or wild mustard, or
corn kale, which, indeed, are not all exactly the same things, though nearly
resembling. These produce such plenty of seeds, that it is very difficult
to clear a field of them, if once they are suffered to grow till the seeds ripen.
An extremely common weed in gardens and by roadsides is shepherd’s-purse,
which is a very good specimen of the pouch-bearing plants of this
tribe, its seed-vessels being exactly the figure of a heart. Lady-smock is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>often so abundant a weed in wet meadows as to make them all over white
with their flowers. Some call this plant cuckoo-flower, because its flowering
is about the same time with the first appearance of that bird in spring.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Geo.</em> I remember some pretty lines in a song about spring, in which
lady-smock is mentioned:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When daisies pied, and violets blue,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lady-smocks all silver white,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Do paint the meadows with delight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> They are Shakspeare’s. You see he gives the name of cuckoo-bud
to some other flower, a yellow one, which appears at the same season.
But still earlier than this time, walls and hedge-banks are enlivened by a
very small white flower, called whitlow-grass, which is one of the tribe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> Is it easy to distinguish the plants of this family from one another?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> Not very easy; for the general similarity of the flowers is so great,
that little distinction can be drawn from them. The marks of the species
are chiefly taken from the form and manner of growth of the seed-vessel,
and we will examine some of them by the descriptions in a book of botany.
There is one very remarkable seed-vessel, which probably you have
observed in the garden. It is a perfectly round large flat pouch, which
after it has shed its seed, remains on the stalk and looks likes a thin white
bladder. The plant bearing it is commonly called honesty.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Har.</em> O, I know it very well! It is put into winter flower-pots.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Tut.</em> True. So much, then, for the tetradynamous or cruciform-flowered
plants. You cannot well mistake them for any other class, if
you remark the six chives, four of them, generally, but not always, longer
than the two others; the single pistil changing either into a long pod or a
round pouch containing the seeds; the four opposite petals of the flower,
and four leaves of the calyx. You may safely make a salad of the young
leaves wherever you find them: the worst they can do to you is to bite
your tongue.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Harford.</em> There is the place! This is the green on which I played
many a day with my companions; there are the tall trees that I have so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>often climbed for birds’-nests; and that is the pond where I used to sail
my walnut-shell boats. What a crowd of mixed sensations rush on my
mind! What pleasures, and what regret! Yes, there is somewhat in
our native soil that affects the mind in a manner different from every other
scene in nature.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beaumont.</em> With you it must be merely the <em>place</em>; for I think you can
have no attachments of friendship or affection in it, considering your long
absence, and the removal of all your family.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> No, I have no family connexions, and indeed can scarcely be
said ever to have had any; for, as you know, I was almost utterly
neglected after the death of my father and mother, and while all my elder
brothers and sisters were dispersed to one part or another, and the little
remaining property was disposed of, I was left with the poor people who
nursed me, to be brought up just as they thought proper; and the little
pension that was paid for me entirely ceased after a few years.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> Then how were you afterward supported?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> The honest couple who had the care of me continued to treat
me with the greatest kindness; and poor as they were, not only maintained
me as a child of their own, but did all in their power to procure me
advantages more suited to my birth than my deserted situation. With
the assistance of the worthy clergyman of the parish, they put me to a
day-school in the village, clothed me decently, and being themselves
sober, religious persons, took care to keep me from vice. The obligations
I am under to them, will, I hope, never be effaced from my memory, and
it is on their account alone that I have undertaken this journey.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> How long did you continue with them?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Till I was thirteen. I then felt an irresistible desire to fight for
my country; and learning by accident that a distant relation of our family
was a captain of a man-of-war, I took leave of my worthy benefactors, and
set off to the seaport where he lay, the good people furnishing me in the
best manner they were able with necessaries for the journey. I shall
never forget the tenderness with which they parted with me. It was, if
possible, beyond that of the kindest parents. You know my subsequent
adventures, from the time of my becoming a midshipman, to my present state
of first-lieutenant of the Britannia. Though it is now fifteen years since
my departure, I feel my affection for these good folks stronger than ever,
and could not be easy without taking the first opportunity of seeing them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> It is a great chance if they are both living.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span><em>Harf.</em> I happened to hear by a young man of the village, not long since,
that they were; but I believe much reduced in their circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> Whereabouts did they live?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Just at the turning of this corner. But what’s this?—I can’t find
the house—yet I am sure I have not forgot the situation. Surely it must
be pulled down! Oh! my dear old friends, what can have become of you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> You had best ask that little girl.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Hark ye, my dear! do you know one John Beech, of this place?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Girl.</em> What, old John Beech? O yes, very well, and Mary Beech, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Where do they live?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Girl.</em> A little farther on in the lane.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Did they not once live hereabouts?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Girl.</em> Yes, till Farmer Tything pulled the house down to make his hop-garden.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Come with me to show me the place, and I’ll give you a penny.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Girl.</em> Yes, that I will. (<em>They walk on.</em>) There—that low thatched
house—and there’s Mary spinning at the door.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> There, my dear (<em>gives money, and the girl goes away</em>). How
my heart beats! Surely that cannot be my nurse! Yes, I recollect her
now; but how very old and sickly she looks!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> Fifteen years in her life, with care and hardship, must go a great
way in breaking her down.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> (<em>going to the cottage-door</em>). Good morning, good woman; can
you give my companion and me something to drink? We are very thirsty
with walking this hot day.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary Beech.</em> I have nothing better than water, sir; but if you please
to accept of that, I will bring you some.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> Thank you—we will trouble you for some.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Will you please to walk in out of the sun, gentlemen; ours is a
very poor house, indeed; but I will find you a seat to sit down on, while
I draw the water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> (<em>to Beau.</em>). The same good creature as ever! Let us go in.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>Scene II.—<em>The inside of the cottage. An old man sitting by the hearth.</em></h3>

<p class='c013'><em>Beau.</em> We have made bold, friend, to trouble your wife for a little water.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Sit down—sit down—gentlemen. I would get up to give you
my chair, but I have the misfortune to be lame, and am almost blind too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Lame and blind! Oh Beaumont! (<em>aside</em>).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span><em>John.</em> Ay, sir, old age will come on; and, God knows, we have very
little means to fence against it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> What, have you nothing but your labour to subsist on?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> We made that do, sir, as long as we could; but now I am hardly
capable of doing anything, and my poor wife can earn very little by spinning,
so we have been forced at last to apply to the parish.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> To the parish! Well I hope they consider the services of your
better days, and provide for you comfortably.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Alas, sir; I am not much given to complain; but what can two
shillings a week do in these hard times?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Little enough, indeed! And is that all they allow you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> It is, sir; and we are not to have that much longer, for they say
we must come into the workhouse.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary</em> (<em>entering with the water</em>). Here, gentlemen, the jug is clean,
if you can drink out of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> The workhouse, do you say?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Yes, gentlemen; that makes my poor husband so uneasy—that
we should come in our old days to die in a workhouse. We have lived
better, I assure you—but we were turned out of our little farm by the great
farmer near the church; and since then we have grown poorer and poorer,
and weaker and weaker, so that we have nothing to help ourselves with.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John</em> (<em>sobbing</em>). To die in a parish workhouse—I can hardly bear the
thought of it! But God knows best, and we must submit!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> But, my good people, have you no children to assist you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Our children, sir, are all dead except one that is settled a long
way off, and as poor as we are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> But surely, my friends, such decent people as you seem to be,
must have somebody to protect you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> No, sir; we know nobody but our neighbours, and they think
the workhouse good enough for the poor.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Pray, was there not a family of Harfords once in this village?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Yes, sir, a long while ago—but they are all dead and gone, or
else far enough from this place.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Ay, sir, the youngest of them, and the finest child among them,
that I’ll say for him, was nursed in our house when we lived on the old spot
near the green. He was with us till he was thirteen, and a sweet-behaved
boy he was; I loved him as well as ever I did any of my own children.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> What became of him?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span><em>John.</em> Why, sir, he was a fine bold-spirited boy, though the best tempered
creature in the world—so last war he would be a sailor, and fight the French
and Spaniards, and away he went, nobody could stop him, and we have
never heard a word of him since.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Ay, he is dead or killed, I warrant—for if he was alive, I am sure
nothing would keep him from coming to see his poor daddy and mamma
as he used to call us. Many a night have I lain awake thinking of him!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> (<em>to Beau.</em>). I can hold no longer.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> (<em>to him</em>). Restrain yourself awhile. Well, my friends, in return
for your kindness, I will tell you some news that will please you. This
same Harford, Edward Harford....</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Ay, that was his name—my dear Ned!—What of him, sir, is he
living?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Let the gentlemen speak, my dear.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> Ned Harford is now alive and well, and a lieutenant in his
majesty’s navy, and as brave an officer as any in the service.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> I hope you do not jest with us, sir?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> I do not, upon my honour.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Oh, thank God—thank God—if I could but see him!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Ay, I wish for nothing more before I die.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Here he is—here he is! My dearest, best benefactors! Here
I am, to pay some of the great debt of kindness I owe you. (<em>Clasps
Mary round the neck, and kisses her.</em>)</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> What—this gentleman my Ned! Ay, it is, it is—I see it, I see it!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Oh, my old eyes!—but I know his voice now. (<em>Stretches out
his hand, which Harford grasps.</em>)</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> My good old man! Oh that you could see me as clearly as I
do you!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Enough—enough—it is you, and I am contented.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> O, happy day! O, happy day!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Did you think I could ever forget you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Oh, no; I knew you better; but how long it is since we parted!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Fifteen years come Whitsuntide.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> The first time I set foot in England all this long interval was
three weeks ago.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> How good you were to come to us so soon!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> What a tall strong man you are grown! but you have the same
sweet smile as ever.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span><em>John.</em> I wish I could see him plain—but what signifies! he’s here, and
I hold him by the hand. Where’s the other good gentleman?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Beau.</em> Here—very happy to see such worthy people made so.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> He has been my dearest friend for a great many years, and I am
beholden to him almost as much as to you two.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Has he? God bless him and reward him!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> I am grieved to think what you must have suffered from hardship
and poverty. But that is all at an end—no workhouse now.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> God bless you! then I shall be happy still. But we must not be
burdensome to you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Don’t talk of that. As long as I have a shilling, it is my duty to
give you sixpence of it. Did you not take care of me when all the world
forsook me, and treated me as your own child when I had no other parent;
and shall I ever forsake you in your old age! Oh never—never!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> Ay, you had always a kind heart of your own. I always used
to think our dear Ned would some time or other prove a blessing to us.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> You must leave this poor hut, that is not fit to keep out the
weather, and we must get you a snug cottage in this village or some other.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Pray, my dear sir, let us die in this town, as we have always
lived in it. And as to a house, I believe that where old Richard Carpenter
used to live in is empty, if it would not be too good for us.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> What, the white cottage on the green? I remember it; it is just
the thing. You shall remove there this very week.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> This is beyond all my hopes and wishes!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> There you shall have a little close to keep a cow—and a girl to
milk her, and take care of you both—and a garden well stocked with herbs
and roots—and a little yard for pigs and poultry; and some good new
furniture for your house.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> O, too much—too much!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> What makes me cry so, when so many good things are coming
to us?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> Who is the landlord of this house?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Our next neighbour, Mr. Wheatfield.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Harf.</em> I’ll go and speak about it directly and then come to you again.
Come, Beaumont. God bless you both!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> God in heaven bless you!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mary.</em> O, happy day. O, happy day!</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PERSEVERANCE AGAINST FORTUNE.—<span class='sc'>A Story.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Theodore was a boy of lively parts and engaging manners; but he
had the failing of being extremely impatient in his temper and inclined
to extremes. He was ardent in all his pursuits, but could bear no
disappointment; and if the least thing went wrong, he threw up what
he was about in a pet, and could not be prevailed upon to resume it. His
father, Mr. Carleton, had given him a bed in the garden, which he had
cultivated with great delight. The borders were set with double daisies
of different colours, next to which was a row of auriculas and polyanthuses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Beyond were stocks and other taller flowers and shrubs; and a beautiful
damask rose graced the centre. This rose was just budding, and Theodore
watched its daily progress with great interest. One unfortunate day, the
door of the garden being left open, a drove of pigs entered, and began to
riot on the herbs and flowers. An alarm being sounded, Theodore and
the servant-boy rushed upon them, smacking their whips. The whole
herd, in affright, took their course across Theodore’s flower-bed, on which
some of them had before been grazing. Stocks, daisies, and auriculas
were all trampled down or torn up; and, what was worst of all, a large
old sow ran directly over the beautiful rose-tree, and broke off its stem
level with the ground. When Theodore came up and beheld all the
mischief, and especially his favourite rose strewed on the soil, rage and
grief choked his utterance. After standing a while the picture of despair,
he snatched up a spade that stood near, and with furious haste dug over
the whole bed, and whelmed all the relics of his flowers deep under the
soil. This exertion being ended, he burst into tears, and silently left the
garden.</p>

<p class='c000'>His father, who had beheld the scene at a distance, though somewhat
diverted at the boy’s childish violence, yet began seriously to reflect on
the future consequences of such a temper, if suffered to grow up without
restraint. He said nothing to him at the time, but in the afternoon he
took a walk with him into a neighbouring parish. There was a large
wild common, and at the skirts of it a neat farmhouse with fields lying
round it, all well fenced, and cultivated in the best manner. The air
was sweetened with the bean-flower and clover. An orchard of fine
young fruit-trees lay behind the house and before it a little garden, gay
with all the flowers of the season. A stand of beehives was on the
southern side, sheltered by a thick hedge of honeysuckle and sweet-brier.
The farmyard was stocked with pigs and poultry. A herd of cows with
full udders was just coming home to be milked. Everything wore the
aspect of plenty and good management. The charms of the scene struck
Theodore very forcibly, and he expressed his pleasure in the warmest
terms. “This place,” said his father, “belongs to a man who is the
greatest example I know of patient fortitude bearing up against misfortune;
and all that you see is the reward of his own perseverance. I am a little
acquainted with him; and we will go in and beg a draught of milk, and
try if we can prevail upon him to tell us his story.” Theodore willingly
accompanied his father. They were received by the farmer with cordial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>frankness. After they were seated, “Mr. Hardman,” says Mr. Carleton,
“I have often heard part of your adventures, but never had a regular
account of the whole. If you will favour me and my little boy with the
story of them, we shall think ourselves much obliged to you.”—“Lacka-day!
sir,” said he, “there’s little in them worth telling of, as far as I
know. I have had my ups and downs in the world, to be sure, but so
have many men besides. However, if you wish to hear about them, they
are at your service; and I can’t say but it gives me pleasure sometimes
to talk over old matters, and think how much better things have turned
out than might have been expected.”—“Now I am of opinion,” said Mr.
Carleton, “that from your spirit and perseverance a good conclusion
might always have been expected.”—“You are pleased to compliment,
sir,” replied the farmer; “but I will begin without more words:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may perhaps have heard that my father was a man of good
estate. He thought of nothing, poor man! but how to spend it; and he
had the uncommon luck to spend it twice over. For when he was obliged
to sell it the first time, it was bought in by a relation, who left it him
by his will. But my poor father was not a man to take warning. He fell
to living as he had done before, and just made his estate and his life hold
out together. He died at the age of five-and-forty, and left his family
beggars. I believe he would not have taken to drinking, as he did, had
it not been for his impatient temper, which made him fret and vex himself
for every trifle, and then he had nothing for it but to drown his care in
liquor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was my lot to be taken by my mother’s brother, who was master of
a merchant-ship. I served him as an apprentice several years, and
underwent a good deal of the usual hardship of a sailor’s life. He had
just made me his mate in a voyage up the Mediterranean, when we had
the misfortune to be wrecked on the coast of Morocco. The ship struck at
some distance from shore, and we lay a long stormy night with the waves
dashing over us, expecting every moment to perish. My uncle and several
of the crew died of fatigue and want, and by morning but four of us were
left alive. My companions were so disheartened, that they thought of
nothing but submitting to their fate. For my part I thought life still
worth struggling for; and the weather having become calmer, I persuaded
them to join me in making a kind of raft, by the help of which, with much
toil and danger, we reached the land. Here we were seized by the
barbarous inhabitants, and carried up the country as slaves to the emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>We were employed about some public buildings, made to work very hard
with the whip at our backs, and allowed nothing but water and a kind of
pulse. I have heard persons talk as if there was little in being a slave
but the name; but they who have been slaves themselves I am sure will
never make light of slavery in others. A ransom was set on our heads,
but so high, that it seemed impossible for poor friendless creatures like us
ever to pay it. The thought of perpetual servitude, together with the
hard treatment we met with, quite overcame my poor companions. They
drooped and died one after another. I still thought it not impossible to
mend my condition, and perhaps to recover my freedom. We worked
about twelve hours in the day, and had one holyday in the week. I
employed my leisure time in learning to make mats and flag-baskets, in
which I soon became so expert as to have a good many for sale, and
thereby got a little money to purchase better food, and several small
conveniences. We were afterward set to work in the emperor’s gardens;
and here I showed so much good will and attention, that I got into favour
with the overseer. He had a large garden of his own; and he made
interest for me to be suffered to work for him alone, on the condition of
paying a man to do my duty. I soon became so useful to him, that he
treated me more like a hired servant than a slave, and gave me regular
wages. I learned the language of the country, and I might have passed
my time comfortably enough could I have accommodated myself to their
manners and religion, and forgotten my native land. I saved all I could
in order to purchase my freedom; but the ransom was so high, that I had
little prospect of being able to do it for some years to come. A circumstance,
however, happened which brought it about at once. Some villains one
night laid a plot to murder my master and plunder his house. I slept
in a little shed in the garden where the tools lay; and being awaked by a
noise, I saw four men break through the fence, and walk up an alley
toward the house. I crept out with a spade in my hand, and silently
followed them. They made a hole with instruments in the house-wall
big enough for a man to enter at. Two of them had got in, and the third
was beginning to enter, when I rushed forward, and with a blow of my
spade clove the scull of one of the robbers, and gave the other such a
stroke on the shoulder as disabled him. I then made a loud outcry to
alarm the family. My master and his son, who lay in the house, got up,
and having let me in, we secured the two others, after a sharp conflict, in
which I received a severe wound with a dagger. My master, who looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>upon me as his preserver, had all possible care taken of me, and as soon
as I was cured made me a present of my liberty. He would fain have
kept me with him, but my mind was so much bent on returning to my
native country, that I immediately set out to the nearest seaport, and took
my passage in a vessel going to Gibraltar.</p>

<p class='c000'>“From this place I returned in the first ship for England. As soon as
we arrived in the Downs, and I was rejoicing at the sight of the white
cliffs, a man-of-war’s boat came on board, and pressed into the king’s
service all of us who were seamen. I could not but think it hard that this
should be my welcome at home after a long slavery, but there was no
remedy. I resolved to do my duty in my station, and leave the rest
to Providence. I was abroad during the remainder of the war, and saw
many a stout fellow sink under disease and despondence. My knowledge
of seamanship got me promoted to the post of a petty officer, and at the
peace I was paid off, and received a pretty sum for wages and prize-money.
With this I set off for London. I had experienced too much
distress from want to be inclined to squander away my money, so I put
it into a banker’s hands, and began to look out for some new way of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Unfortunately, there were some things of which I had no more
experience than a child, and the tricks of London were among these. An
advertisement offering extraordinary advantages to a partner in a commercial
concern who could bring a small capital, tempted me to make
inquiry about the matter; and I was soon cajoled by a plausible artful
fellow to venture my whole stock in it. The business was a manufacture,
about which I knew nothing at all; but as I was not afraid of my labour,
I set about working as they directed me, with great diligence, and thought
all was going on prosperously. One morning, on coming to the office, I
found my partners decamped; and the same day I was arrested for a
considerable sum due by the partnership. It was in vain for me to think
of getting bail, so I was obliged to go to prison. Here I should have been
half starved, but for my Moorish trade of matmaking, by the help of
which I bettered my condition for some months; when the creditors,
finding that nothing could be got out of me, suffered me to be set at liberty.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was now in the wide world without a farthing or a friend, but I,
thank God, had limbs and health left.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I did not choose to trust the sea again, but preferred my other new
trade of gardening; so I applied to a nurseryman near town, and was
received as a day-labourer. I set myself cheerfully at work, taking care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>to be in the grounds the first man in the morning, and the last at night. I
acquainted my employer with all the practices I had observed in Morocco,
and got him, in return, to instruct me in his own. In time, I came to be
considered as a skilful workman, and was advanced to higher wages. My
affairs were in a flourishing state. I was well fed, and comfortably lodged,
and saved money into the bargain. About this time I fell in company
with a young woman at service, very notable and well behaved, who
seemed well qualified for a wife to a working-man. I ventured to make
an offer to her, which proved not disagreeable; and after we had calculated
a little how we were to live, we married. I took a cottage with an acre
or two of land to it, and my wife’s saving furnished our house, and bought
a cow. All my leisure time I spent upon my piece of ground, which
I made very productive, and the profits of my cow, with my wages,
supported us very well. No mortal, I think, could be happier than I was
after a hard day’s work, by my own fireside, with my wife beside me, and
our little infant on my knee.</p>

<p class='c000'>“After this way of life had lasted two or three years, a gentleman who
had dealt largely with my master for young plants, asked him if he could
recommend an honest industrious man for a tenant, upon some land that
he had lately taken in from the sea. My master, willing to do me a
kindness, mentioned me. I was tempted by the proposal, and going down
to view the premises, I took a farm upon a lease at a low rent, and removed
my family and goods to it, one hundred and fifty miles from London.
There was ground enough for money, but much was left to be done for it
in draining, manuring, and fencing. Then it required more stock than I
was able to furnish; so, though unwilling, I was obliged to borrow some
money of my landlord, who let me have it at a moderate interest. I began
with a good heart, and worked late and early to put things into the best
condition. My first misfortune was that the place proved unhealthy to us.
I fell into a lingering ague, which pulled me down much, and hindered
my business. My wife got a slow fever, and so did our eldest child (we
had now two.) The poor child died; and what with grief and illness,
my wife had much ado to recover. Then the rot got among my sheep,
and carried off the best part of my stock. I bore up against distress as
well as I could; and by the kindness of my landlord, was enabled to
bring things tolerably about again. We regained our health, and began
to be seasoned to the climate. As we were cheering ourselves with the
prospect of better times, a dreadful storm arose—it was one night in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>February—I shall never forget it—and drove the spring tide with such
fury against our sea-banks, that they gave way. The water rushed in
with such force, that all was presently a sea. Two hours before daylight
I was awakened by the noise of the waves dashing against our house, and
bursting in at the door. My wife and I and the two children (the younger
but four weeks old) slept on a ground floor. We had just time to carry
the children up stairs, before all was afloat in the room. When day
appeared, we could see nothing from the windows but water. All the
outhouses, ricks, and utensils were swept away, and all the cattle and
sheep drowned. The sea kept rising, and the force of the current bore
so hard against our house, that we thought every moment it must
fall. We clasped our babies to our breasts, and expected nothing but
present death. At length, we spied a boat coming to us. With a good
deal of difficulty it got under our window, and took us in with a servant-maid
and boy. A few clothes was all the property we saved; and we
had not left the house half an hour, before it fell, and in a minute nothing
was to be seen of it. Not only the farmhouse, but the farm itself was
gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was now again a ruined man, and, what was worse, I had three
partners in my ruin. My wife and I looked at one another, and then at
our little ones, and wept. Neither of us had a word of comfort to say.
At last, thought I, this country is not Morocco, however. Here are good
souls that will pity our case, and perhaps relieve us. Then I have a
character, and a pair of hands. Things are bad but they might have been
worse. I took my wife by the hand, and knelt down. She did the same.
I thanked God for his mercy in saving our lives, and prayed that he would
continue to protect us. We rose up with lightened hearts, and were able
to talk calmly about our condition. It was my desire to return to my
former master, the nurseryman; but how to convey my family so far
without money was the difficulty. Indeed I was much worse than
nothing, for I owed a good deal to my landlord. He came down upon
the news of the misfortune, and though his own losses were heavy, he
not only forgave my debt and released me from all obligations, but made
me a small present. Some charitable neighbours did the like; but I was
most of all affected by the kindness of our late maid-servant, who insisted
upon our accepting of a crown which she had saved out of her wages.
Poor soul! we had always treated her like one of ourselves, and she felt for
us like one.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“As soon as we had got some necessaries, and the weather was tolerable,
we set out on our long march. My wife carried her infant in her arms.
I took the bigger child on my back, and a bundle of clothes in my hand.
We could walk but a few miles a day, but we now and then got a lift in
an empty wagon or cart, which was a great help to us. One day we
met with a farmer returning with his team from market, who let me ride,
and entered into conversation with me. I told him of my adventures, by
which he seemed much interested; and learning that I was skilled in
managing trees, he acquainted me that a nobleman in his neighbourhood
was making great plantations, and would very likely be glad to engage
me; and he offered to carry us to the place. As all I was seeking was a
living by my labour, I thought the sooner I got it the better; so I thankfully
accepted his offer. He took us to the nobleman’s steward, and made
known our case. The steward wrote to my old master for a character;
and receiving a favourable one, he hired me as a principal manager of a
new plantation, and settled me and my family in a snug cottage near it.
He advanced us somewhat for furniture and present subsistence, and we
had once more a <em>home</em>. O sir! how many blessings are contained in that
word to those who have known the want of it!</p>

<p class='c000'>“I entered upon my new employment with as much satisfaction as if I
was taking possession of an estate. My wife had enough to do in taking
care of the house and children; so it lay with me to provide for all, and
I may say that I was not idle. Besides my weekly pay from the steward,
I contrived to make a little money at leisure times by pruning and
dressing gentlemen’s fruit-trees. I was allowed a piece of waste ground
behind the house for a garden, and I spent a good deal of labour in bringing
it into order. My old master sent me down for a present some choice
young trees and flower-roots, which I planted, and they throve wonderfully.
Things went on almost as well as I could desire. The situation
being dry and healthy, my wife recovered her lost bloom, and the children
sprung up like my plants. I began to hope that I was almost out of the
reach of further misfortune; but it was not so ordered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had been three years in this situation, and increased my family with
another child, when my lord died. He was succeeded by a very dissipated
young man, deep in debt, who presently put a stop to the planting and
improving of the estate, and sent orders to turn off all the workmen. This
was a great blow to me; however, I still hoped to be allowed to keep my
little house and garden, and I thought I could then maintain myself as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>nurseryman and gardener. But a new steward was sent down, with
directions to rack the tenants to the utmost. He asked me as much rent
for the place as if I had found the garden ready made to my hands; and
when I told him it was impossible for me to pay it, he gave me notice to
quit immediately. He would neither suffer me to take away my trees
and plants, nor allow me anything for them. His view, I found, was to
put in a favourite of his own, and set him up at my expense. I remonstrated
against this cruel injustice, but could obtain nothing but hard words.
As I saw it would be the ruin of me to be turned out in that manner, I
determined, rather hastily, to go up to London, and plead my cause with
my new lord. I took a sorrowful leave of my family, and walking to the
next market-town, I got a place on the outside of the stage-coach. When
we were within thirty or forty miles of London, the coachman overturned
the carriage, and I pitched directly on my head, and was taken up senseless.
Nobody knew anything about me; so I was carried to the next
village, where the overseer had me taken to the parish workhouse. Here
I lay a fortnight, much neglected, before I came to my senses. As soon
as I became sensible of my condition, I was almost distracted in thinking
of the distress of my poor wife, who was near lying-in, must be under on
my account, not hearing anything of me. I lay another fortnight before
I was fit to travel, for besides the hurt on my head, I had a broken collarbone,
and several bruises.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My money had somehow all got out of my pocket, and I had no other
means of getting away than by being passed to my own parish. I returned
in sad plight, indeed, and found my wife very ill in bed. My children
were crying about her, and almost starving. We should now have been
quite lost, had I not raised a little money by selling our furniture; for I
was yet unable to work. As soon as my wife was somewhat recovered,
we were forced to quit our house. I cried like a child on leaving my
blooming garden and flourishing plantations, and was almost tempted to
demolish them, rather than that another should unjustly reap the fruit of
my labours. But I checked myself and I am glad that I did. We took
lodgings in a neighbouring village, and I went round among the gentlemen
of the country to see if I could get a little employment. In the
meantime, the former steward came down to settle accounts with his
successor, and was much concerned to find me in such a situation. He
was a very able and honest man, and had been engaged by another
nobleman to superintend a large improvable estate, in a distant part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the kingdom. He told me, if I would try my fortune with him once
more he would endeavour to procure me a new settlement. I had nothing
to lose, and, therefore, was willing enough to run any hazard, but I was
destitute of means to convey my family to such a distance. My good
friend, who was much provoked at the injustice of the new steward, said
so much to him, that he brought him to make me an allowance for my
garden; and with that I was enabled to make another removal. It was
to the place I now inhabit.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I came here, sir, all this farm was a naked common like that
you crossed in coming. My lord got an enclosure-bill for his part of it,
and the steward divided it into different farms, and let it on improving
leases to several tenants. A dreary spot to be sure it looked at first, enough
to sink a man’s heart to sit down upon it. I had a little unfinished cottage
given me to live in; and as I had nothing to stock a farm, I was for some
years employed as head labourer and planter about the new enclosures.
By very hard working and saving, together with a little help, I was at
length enabled to take a small part of the ground I now occupy. I had
various discouragements, from bad seasons and other accidents. One year
the distemper carried off four out of seven cows that I kept; another year
I lost two of my best horses. A high wind once almost entirely destroyed
an orchard I had just planted, and blew down my biggest barn. But I
was too much used to misfortunes to be easily disheartened, and my way
always was to set about repairing them in the best manner I could, and
leave the rest to Heaven. This method seems to have answered at last.
I have now gone on many years in a course of continued prosperity, adding
field to field, increasing my stock, and bringing up a numerous family with
credit. My dear wife, who was my faithful partner through so much
distress, continues to share my prosperous state; and few couples in the
kingdom, I believe, have more cause to be thankful for their lot. This,
sir, is my history. You see it contains nothing very extraordinary; but
if it impresses on the mind of this young gentleman the maxim that
patience and perseverance will scarcely fail of a good issue in the end,
the time you have spent in listening to it will not entirely be lost.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Carleton thanked the good farmer very heartily for the amusement
and instruction he had afforded them, and took leave with many expressions
of regard. Theodore and he walked home, talking by the way of
what they had heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next morning, Mr. C. looking out of the window, saw Theodore hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>at work in his garden. He was carefully disinterring his buried flowers,
trimming and cleaning them, and planting them anew. He had got the
gardener to cut a slip of the broken rose-tree, and set it in the middle to
give it a chance of growing. By noon everything was laid smooth and
neat, and the bed was well filled. All its splendour, indeed, was gone
for the present, but it seemed in a hopeful way to revive again. Theodore
looked with pleasure over his work; but his father felt more pleasure in
witnessing the first-fruits of Farmer Hardman’s story.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE PRICE OF A VICTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Good news! great news! glorious news!” cried young Oswald, as
he entered his father’s house. “We have got a complete victory, and have
killed I don’t know how many thousands of the enemy; and we are to
have bonfires and illuminations!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And so,” said his father, “you think that killing a great many
thousands of human creatures is a thing to be very glad about?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Oswald.</em> No—I do not quite think so, neither: but surely it is right to
be glad that our country has gained a great advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span><em>Father.</em> No doubt, it is right to wish well to our country, as far as
its prosperity can be promoted without injuring the rest of mankind. But
wars are very seldom to the real advantage of any nation; and when they
are ever so useful or necessary, so many dreadful evils attend them, that
a humane man will scarcely rejoice in them, if he considers at all on the
subject.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> But if our enemies would do us a great deal of mischief, and we
prevent it by beating them, have we not a right to be glad of it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Alas! we are in general little judges which of the parties has the
most mischievous intentions. Commonly, they are both in the wrong,
and success will make both of them unjust and unreasonable. But putting
this out of the question, he who rejoices in the event of a battle, rejoices
in the misery of many thousands of his species; and the thought of that
should make him pause a little. Suppose a surgeon were to come with a
smiling countenance, and tell us triumphantly that he had cut off half a
dozen legs to day, what would you think of him?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> I should think him very hard-hearted.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> And yet those operations are done for the benefit of the sufferers,
and by their own desire. But in a battle, the probability is, that none of
those engaged on either side have any interest at all in the cause they are
fighting for, and most of them come there because they cannot help it. In
this battle that you are so rejoiced about, there have been ten thousand
men killed on the spot, and nearly as many wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> On both sides?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Yes—but they are <em>men</em> on both sides. Consider now, that the ten
thousand sent out of the world in this morning’s work, though they are
past feeling themselves, have left probably two persons each, on an
average, to lament their loss, parents, wives, or children. Here are then
twenty thousand people made unhappy, at one stroke on their account.
This, however, is hardly so dreadful to think of, as the condition of the
wounded. At the moment we are talking, eight or ten thousand more
are lying in agony, torn with shot, or gashed with cuts, their wounds all
festering, some hourly to die a most excruciating death, others to linger
in torture weeks and months, and many doomed to drag on a miserable
existence for the rest of their lives, with diseased and mutilated bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> This is shocking to think of, indeed!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> When you light your candles, then, this evening, <em>think what they
cost</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span><em>Os.</em> But everybody else is glad, and seems to think nothing of these
things.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> True—they do <em>not</em> think of them. If they did, I cannot suppose
they would be so void of feeling as to enjoy themselves in merriment
when so many of their fellow-creatures are made miserable. Do you not
remember, when poor Dickens had his legs broken to pieces by a loaded
wagon, how all the town pitied him?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> Yes, very well. I could not sleep the night after for thinking of
him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> But here are thousands suffering as much as he, and we scarce
bestow a single thought on them. If any one of these poor creatures were
before our eyes, we should probably feel much more than we do now for
them altogether. Shall I tell you a story of a soldier’s fortune, that came
to my own knowledge?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> Yes; pray, do.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> In the village where I went to school, there was an honest industrious
weaver and his wife, who had an only son, named Walter, just
come to man’s estate. Walter was a good and dutiful lad, and a clever
workman, so that he was a great help to his parents. One unlucky day,
having gone to the next market-town with some work, he met with a
companion, who took him to the alehouse and treated him. As he was
coming away, a recruiting sergeant entered the room, who seeing Walter
to be a likely young fellow, had a great mind to entrap him. He persuaded
him to sit down again and take a glass with him; and kept him in talk
with fine stories about a soldier’s life, till Walter got fuddled before he
was aware. The sergeant then clapped a shilling into his hand to drink
his majesty’s health, and told him he was enlisted. He was kept there
all night, and next morning was taken before a magistrate to be sworn in.
Walter had now become sober, and was very sorry for what he had done:
but he was told that he could not get off without paying a guinea smart
money. This he knew not how to raise; and being likewise afraid and
ashamed to face his friends, he took the oath and bounty-money, and
marched away with the sergeant, without ever returning home. His poor
father and mother, when they heard of the affair, were almost heart-broken;
and a young woman in the village, who was his sweetheart, had
like to have gone distracted. Walter sent them a line from the first stage,
to bid them farewell, and comfort them. He joined his regiment, which
soon embarked for Germany, where it continued till the peace. Walter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>once or twice sent word home of his welfare, but for the last year nothing
was heard of him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> Where was he then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> You shall hear. One summer’s evening, a man in an old red coat,
hobbling on crutches, was seen to enter the village. His countenance
was pale and sickly, his cheeks hollow, and his whole appearance bespoke
extreme wretchedness. Several people gathered round him, looking
earnestly in his face. Among these a young woman having gazed at him
a while, cried out, “My Walter!” and fainted away. Walter fell on the
ground beside her. His father and mother being fetched by some of the
spectators, came and took him in their arms, weeping bitterly. I saw the
whole scene, and shall never forget it. At length, the neighbours helped
them into the house, where Walter told them the following story:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“At the last great battle that our troops gained in Germany, I was
among the first engaged, and received a shot that broke my thigh. I fell,
and presently after our regiment was forced to retreat. A squadron of the
enemy’s horse came galloping down upon us. A trooper making a blow
at me with his sabre as I lay, I lifted up my arm to save my head, and
got a cut which divided all the sinews at the back of my wrist. Soon
after the enemy were driven back, and came across us again. A horse
set his foot on my side, and broke three of my ribs. The action was
long and bloody, and the wounded on both sides were left on the field
all night. A dreadful night it was to me you may think! I had fainted
through loss of blood, and when I recovered, I was tormented with thirst,
and the cold air made my wounds smart intolerably. About noon next
day wagons came to carry away those who remained alive; and I, with
a number of others, was put into one to be conveyed to the next town.
The motion of the carriage was terrible for my broken bones—every jolt
went to my heart. We were taken to an hospital, which was crammed as
full as it could hold; and we should all have been suffocated with the
heat and stench, had not a fever broke out, which soon thinned our
numbers. I took it, and was twice given over; however, I struggled
through. But my wounds proved so difficult to heal, that it was almost a
twelvemonth before I could be discharged. A great deal of the bone in
my thigh came away in splinters, and left the limb crooked and useless as
you see. I entirely lost the use of three fingers of my right hand; and
my broken ribs made me spit blood a long time, and have left a cough and
difficulty of breathing, which I believe will bring me to my grave. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>sent home, and discharged from the army, and I have begged my way
hither as well as I could. I am told that the peace has left the affairs of
my country just as they were before; but who will restore me my health
and limbs? I am put on the list for a Chelsea pensioner, which will
support me, if I live to receive it, without being a burden to my friends.
That is all that remains for Walter now.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> Poor Walter! What became of him afterward?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Father.</em> The wound in his thigh broke out afresh, and discharged more
splinters after a great deal of pain and fever. As winter came on, his
cough increased. He wasted to a skeleton, and died the next spring.
The young woman, his sweetheart, sat up with him every night to the
last; and soon after his death, she fell into a consumption, and followed
him. The old people, deprived of the stay and comfort of their age, fell
into despair and poverty, and were taken into the workhouse, where they
ended their days.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the history of <em>Walter the soldier</em>. It has been that of thousands
more; and will be that of many a poor fellow, over whose fate you
are now rejoicing. Such is the <em>price of a victory</em>!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>GOOD COMPANY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Be sure, Frederick, always keep <em>good company</em>,” was the final
admonition of Mr. Lofty, on dismissing his son to the University.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I entreat you, Henry, always to choose <em>good company</em>,” said Mr.
Manly, on parting with his son to an apprenticeship in a neighbouring town.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was impossible for two people to mean more differently by the
same words.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Mr. Lofty’s idea, <em>good</em> company was that of persons superior to
ourselves in rank and fortune. By this alone he estimated it: and the
degrees of comparison, better and best, were made exactly to correspond
to such a scale. Thus, if an esquire was <em>good</em> company, a baronet was
<em>better</em>, and a lord <em>best of all</em>, provided that he was not a <em>poor</em> lord, for in
that case, a rich gentleman might be at least as good. For as, according
to Mr. Lofty’s maxim, the great purpose for which companions were to be
chosen was to advance a young man in the world by their credit and
interest, those were to be preferred who afforded the best prospects in this
respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Manly, on the other hand, understood by <em>good</em> company, that which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>was improving to the morals and understanding; and by the <em>best</em>, that
which, to a high degree of these qualities, added true politeness of manners.
As superior advantages in education to a certain point accompany
superiority of condition, he wished his son to prefer as companions those
whose situation in life had afforded them the opportunity of being well
educated; but he was far from desiring him to shun connexions with worth
and talents, wherever he should find them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Lofty had an utter aversion to <em>low company</em>, by which he meant
inferiors, people of no fashion and figure, shabby fellows whom nobody
knows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Manly equally disliked <em>low company</em>, understanding by it persons
of mean habits and vulgar conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great part of Mr. Manly’s <em>good</em> company was Mr. Lofty’s <em>low</em> company;
and not a few of Mr. Lofty’s very <em>best</em> company were Mr. Manly’s
very <em>worst</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each of the sons understood his father’s meaning, and followed his
advice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frederick, from the time of his entrance at the University, commenced
what is called a <em>tuft-hunter</em>, from the tuft in the cap worn by young
noblemen. He took pains to insinuate himself into the good graces of all
the young men of high fashion in his college, and became a constant
companion in their schemes of frolic and dissipation. They treated him
with an insolent familiarity, often bordering upon contempt; but following
another maxim of his father, “one must stoop to rise,” he took it all in
good part. He totally neglected study as unnecessary, and indeed inconsistent
with his plan. He spent a great deal of money, with which his
father, finding that it went in <em>good company</em>, at first supplied him freely.
In time, however, his expenses amounted to so much, that Mr. Lofty, who
kept good company too, found it difficult to answer his demands. A considerable
sum that he lost at play with one of his noble friends increased
the difficulty. If it were not paid, the disgrace of not having discharged
a <em>debt of honour</em> would lose him all the favour he had acquired; yet the
money could not be raised without greatly embarrassing his father’s affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of this perplexity, Mr. Lofty died, leaving behind him a
large family, and very little property. Frederick came up to town, and
soon dissipated in <em>good company</em> the scanty portion that came to his share.
Having neither industry, knowledge, nor reputation, he was then obliged
to become an humble dependant on the great, flattering all their follies, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>ministering to their vices, treated by them with mortifying neglect, and
equally despised and detested by the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>Henry, in the meantime, entered with spirit into the business of his
new profession, and employed his leisure in cultivating an acquaintance
with a few select friends. These were partly young men in a situation
similar to his own, partly persons already settled in life, but all distinguished
by propriety of conduct and improved understandings. From all
of them he learned something valuable, but he was more particularly
indebted to two of them, who were in a station of life inferior to that of
the rest. One was a watchmaker, an excellent mechanic and tolerable
mathematician, and well acquainted with the construction and use of all
the instruments employed in experimental philosophy. The other was a
young druggist, who had a good knowledge of chymistry, and frequently
employed himself in chymical operations and experiments. Both of them
were men of very decent manners, and took a pleasure in communicating
their knowledge to such as showed a taste for similar studies. Henry
frequently visited them, and derived much useful information from their
instructions, for which he ever expressed great thankfulness. These
various occupations and good examples effectually preserved him from the
errors of youth, and he passed his time with credit and satisfaction. He
had the same misfortune with Frederick, just as he was ready to come out
into the world, of losing his father, upon whom the support of the family
chiefly depended; but in the character he had established, and the knowledge
he had acquired, he found an effectual resource. One of his young
friends proposed to him a partnership in a manufactory he had just set up
at considerable expense, requiring for his share only the exertion of his
talents and industry. Henry accepted the offer, and made such good use
of the skill in mechanics and chymistry he had acquired, that he introduced
many improvements into the manufactory, and rendered it a very profitable
concern. He lived prosperous and independent, and retained in manhood
all the friendships of his youth.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE WANDERER’S RETURN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was a delightful evening about the end of August. The sun, setting
in a pure sky, illuminated the tops of the western hills, and tipped the
opposite trees with a yellow lustre.</p>

<p class='c000'>A traveller, with sunburnt cheeks and dusty feet, strong and active,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>having a knapsack at his back, had gained the summit of a steep ascent,
and stood gazing on the plain below.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a wide tract of champaign country, checkered with villages,
whose towers and spires peeped above the trees in which they were
embosomed. The space between them was chiefly arable land, from
which the last products of the harvest were busily carrying away.</p>

<p class='c000'>A rivulet wound through the plain, its course marked with gray willows.
On its banks were verdant meadows, covered with lowing herds, moving
slowly to the milkmaids, who came tripping along with pails on their
heads. A thick wood clothed the side of a gentle eminence rising from
the water, crowned with the ruins of an ancient castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edward (that was the traveller’s name) dropped on one knee, and
clasping his hands, exclaimed, “Welcome, welcome, my dear native land.
Many a sweet spot have I seen since I left thee, but none so sweet as
thou! Never has thy dear image been out of my memory; and now with
what transport do I retrace all thy charms! O, receive me again, never
more to quit thee!” So saying, he threw himself on the turf; and having
kissed it, rose and proceeded on his journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he descended into the plain, he overtook a little group of children,
merrily walking along the path, and stopping now and then to gather
berries in the hedge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where are you going, my dears?” said Edward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are going home,” they all replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And where is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, to Summerton, that town there among the trees, just before us.
Don’t you see it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see it well,” answered Edward, the tear standing in his eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what is your name—and yours—and yours?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The little innocents told their names. Edward’s heart leaped at the
well-known sounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what is <em>your</em> name, my dear?” said he to a pretty girl, somewhat
older than the rest, who hung back shyly, and held the hand of a ruddy,
white-headed boy, just breeched.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is Rose Walsingham, and this is my younger brother, Roger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Walsingham!” Edward clasped the girl round the neck, and
surprised her with two or three very close kisses. He then lifted up
little Roger, and almost devoured him. Roger seemed as if he wanted
to be set down again, but Edward told him he would carry him home.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“And can you show me the house you live at, Rose?” said Edward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes—it is just there, beside the pond, with the great barn before it,
and the orchard behind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And will you take me home with you, Rose?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you please,” answered Rose, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>They walked on; Edward said but little, for his heart was full, but he
frequently kissed little Roger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coming at length to a stile from which a path led across a little close,
“This is the way to our house,” said Rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other children parted. Edward set down Roger, and got over
the stile. He still, however, kept hold of the boy’s hand. He trembled,
and looked wildly around him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they approached the house, an<a id='p308'></a> old mastiff came running to
meet the children. He looked up at Edward rather sourly, and gave a
little growl; when all at once his countenance changed; he leaped upon
him, licked his hand, wagged his tail, murmured in a soft voice, and
seemed quite overcome with joy. Edward stooped down, patted his head,
and cried, “Poor Captain, what! are you alive, yet?” Rose was surprised
that the stranger and their dog should know one another.</p>

<p class='c000'>They all entered the house together. A good-looking middle-aged
woman was busied in preparing articles of cookery, assisted by her
grown-up daughter. She spoke to the children as they came in,
and casting a look of some surprise on Edward, asked him what his
business was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edward was some time silent; at length, with a faltering voice, he
cried, “Have you forgot me, mother?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Edward! my son Edward!” exclaimed the good woman. And they
were instantly locked in each other’s arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My brother Edward!” said Molly; and took her turn for an embrace,
as soon as her mother gave her room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you my brother?” said Rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That I am,” replied Edward, with another kiss. Little Roger looked
hard at him, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>News of Edward’s arrival soon flew across the yard, and in came from
the barn his father, his next brother, Thomas, and the third, William.
The father fell on his neck, and sobbed out his welcome and blessing.
Edward had not hands enough for them all to shake.</p>

<p class='c000'>An aged, white-headed labourer came in, and held out his shrivelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>hand. Edward gave it a hearty squeeze. “God bless you,” said old
Isaac; “this is the best day I have seen this many a year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And where have you been this long while?” cried the father. “Eight
years and more,” added the mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>His elder brother took off his knapsack; and Molly drew him a chair.
Edward seated himself, and they all gathered round him; the old dog
got within the circle and lay at his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“O, how glad I am to see you all again!” were Edward’s first words.
“How well you look, mother! but father grows thinner. As for the rest, I
should have known none of you, unless it had been Thomas and old Isaac.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a sunburnt face you have got!—but you look brave and
hearty,” cried his mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ay, mother, I have been enough in the sun, I assure you. From
seventeen to five-and-twenty I have been a wanderer upon the face of the
earth, and I have seen more in that time than most men in the course of
their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our young landlord, you know, took such a liking to me at school,
that he would have me go with him on his travels. We went through
most of the countries of Europe, and at last to Naples, where my poor
master took a fever and died. I never knew what grief was till then;
and I believe the thoughts of leaving me in a strange country went as
much to his heart as his illness. An intimate acquaintance of his, a rich
young West Indian, seeing my distress, engaged me to go with him in a
voyage he was about to make to Jamaica. We were too short a time in
England before we sailed, for me to come and see you first, but I wrote
you a letter from the Downs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We never received it,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was a pity,” returned Edward; “for you must have concluded
I was either dead or had forgotten you. Well—we arrived safe in the
West Indies, and there I stayed till I had buried that master, too; for
young men die fast in that country. I was very well treated, but I could
never like the place; and yet Jamaica is a very fine island, and has many
good people in it. But for me, used to see freemen work cheerfully along
with their masters—to behold nothing but droves of black slaves in the
fields, toiling in the burning sun, under the constant dread of the lash of
hard-hearted task-masters—it was what I could not bring myself to bear;
and though I might have been made an overseer of a plantation, I chose
rather to live in a town, and follow some domestic occupation. I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>soon have got rich there; but I fell into a bad state of health, and people
were dying all round me of the yellow fever; so I collected my little
property, and though a war had broken out, I ventured to embark with it
for England.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ship was taken, and carried into the Havana, and I lost my all
and my liberty besides. However, I had the good fortune to ingratiate
myself with a Spanish merchant whom I had known at Jamaica, and he
took me with him to the continent of South America. I visited great
part of this country, once possessed by flourishing and independent nations,
but now groaning under the severe yoke of their haughty conquerers. I
saw those famous gold and silver mines, where the poor natives worked
naked, for ever shut out from the light of day, in order that the wealth of
their unhappy land may go to spread luxury and corruption throughout the
remotest regions of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I accompanied my master across the great southern ocean, a voyage
of some months, without the sight of anything but water and sky. We
came to the rich city of Manilla, the capital of the Spanish settlements
in those parts. There I had my liberty restored, along with a handsome
reward for my services. I got thence to China; and from China to the
English settlements in the East Indies, where the sight of my countrymen,
and the sounds of my native tongue, made me fancy myself almost at home
again, though still separated by half the globe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here I saw a delightful country, swarming with industrious inhabitants,
some cultivating the land, others employed in manufactures, but of
so gentle and effeminate a disposition, that they have always fallen under
the yoke of their invaders. Here how was I forced to blush for my
countrymen, whose avarice and rapacity so often have laid waste this
fair land, and brought on it all the horrors of famine and desolation! I
have seen human creatures quarrelling like dogs for bare bones thrown
upon a dunghill. I have seen fathers selling their families for a little rice,
and mothers entreating strangers to take their children for slaves, that
they might not die of hunger. In the midst of such scenes I saw pomp
and luxury of which our country affords no examples.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Having remained here a considerable time, I gladly at length set my
face homeward, and joined a company who undertook the long and
perilous journey to Europe over land. We crossed vast tracts both desert
and cultivated; sandy plains parched with heat and drought, and infested
with bands of ferocious plunderers. I have seen a well of muddy water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>more valued than ten camel-loads of treasure; and a few half-naked
horsemen strike more terror than a king with all his guards. At length,
after numberless hardships and dangers, we arrived at civilized Europe,
and forgot all we had suffered. As I came nearer my native land, I grew
more and more impatient to reach it; and when I had set foot on it, I
was still more restless till I could see again my beloved home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here I am at last—happy in bringing back a sound constitution and
a clear conscience. I have also brought enough of the relics of my
honest gains to furnish a little farm in the neighbourhood, where I mean
to sit down and spend my days in the midst of those whom I love better
than all the world besides.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Edward had finished, kisses and kind shakes of the hand were
again repeated, and his mother brought out a large slice of harvest-cake,
with a bottle of her nicest currant-wine, to refresh him after his day’s
march. “You are come,” said his father, “at a lucky time, for this is
our harvest-supper. We shall have some of our neighbours to make
merry with us, who will be almost as glad to see you as we are—for you
were always a favourite among them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not long before the visiters arrived. The young folks ran out
to meet them, crying, “Our Edward’s come back—our Edward’s come
home! Here he is—this is he;” and so without ceremony they introduced
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Welcome!—welcome!—God bless you!” sounded on all sides.
Edward knew all the elderly ones at first sight, but the young people
puzzled him for awhile. At length he recollected this to have been his
schoolfellow, and that his companion in driving plough; and he was not
long in finding out his favourite and playfellow Sally, of the next farmhouse,
whom he left a romping girl of fifteen, and now saw a blooming
full-formed young woman of three-and-twenty. He contrived in the
evening to get next her: and though she was somewhat reserved at first,
they had pretty well renewed their intimacy before the company broke up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Health to Edward, and a happy settlement among us!” was the
parting toast. When all were retired, the <em>Returned Wanderer</em> went to
rest in the very room in which he was born, having first paid fervent
thanks to Heaven for preserving him to enjoy a blessing the dearest to
his heart.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>DIFFERENCE AND AGREEMENT OR, SUNDAY MORNING.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>It was Sunday morning. All the bells were ringing for church, and
the streets were filled with people moving in all directions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here, numbers of well-dressed persons, and a long train of charity
children, were thronging in at the wide doors of a large handsome church.
There, a smaller number, almost equally gay in dress, were entering an
elegant meetinghouse. Up one alley, a Roman Catholic congregation
was turning into their retired chapel, every one crossing himself with a
finger dipped in holy water as he went in. The opposite side of the street
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>was covered with a train of Quakers, distinguished by their plain and neat
attire and sedate aspect, who walked without ceremony into a room as
plain as themselves, and took their seats, the men on one side, and the
women on the other, in silence. A spacious building was filled with an
overflowing crowd of Methodists, most of them meanly habited, but decent
and serious in demeanour; while a small society of Baptists in the neighbourhood
quietly occupied their humble place of assembly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently, the different services began. The church resounded with
the solemn organ, and with the indistinct murmurs of a large body of
people following the minister in responsive prayers. From the meeting
were heard the low psalm, and the single voice of the leader of their
devotions. The Roman Catholic chapel was enlivened by strains of
music, the tinkling of a small bell, and a perpetual change of service and
ceremonial. A profound silence and unvarying look and posture announced
the self-recollection and mental devotion of the Quakers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Ambrose led his son Edwin round all these different assemblies as
a spectator. Edwin viewed everything with great attention, and was often
impatient to inquire of his father the meaning of what he saw; but Mr.
Ambrose would not suffer him to disturb any of the congregation even by
a whisper. When they had gone through the whole, Edwin found a
greater number of questions to put to his father, who explained everything
put to him in the best manner he could. At length says Edwin:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“But why cannot all these people agree to go to the same place, and
worship God the same way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And why should they agree?” replied his father. “Don’t you see
that people differ in a hundred other things? Do they all dress alike,
and eat and drink alike, and keep the same hours, and use the same
diversions?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ay—but those are things in which they have a right to do as they
please.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And they have a right, too, to worship God as they please. It is their
own business, and concerns none but themselves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But has not God ordered particular ways of worshipping him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has directed the mind and spirit with which he is to be worshipped,
but not the particular form or manner. That is left for every one to
choose, according as suits his temper and opinions. All these people like
their own way best, and why should they leave it for the choice of another?
Religion is one of the things in which <em>mankind were made to differ</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>The several congregations now began to be dismissed, and the street
was again overspread with persons of all the different sects, going promiscuously
to their respective homes. It chanced that a poor man fell down
in the street in a fit of apoplexy, and lay for dead. His wife and children
stood round him crying and lamenting in the bitterest distress. The
beholders immediately flocked round, and with looks and expressions of
the warmest compassion, gave their help. A Churchman raised the man
from the ground by lifting him under the arms, while a Dissenter held his
head, and wiped his face with his handkerchief. A Roman Catholic lady
took out her smelling-bottle, and assiduously applied it to his nose. A
Methodist ran for a doctor. A Quaker supported and comforted the
woman, and a Baptist took care of the children.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edwin and his father were among the spectators. “Here,” said Mr.
Ambrose, “is a thing in <em>which mankind were made to agree</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Landlord.</em> Good morning to you, Betty.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Betty.</em> Ah!—is it your honour? How do you do, sir? how are madam
and all the good family?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Very well, thank you; and how are you, and all yours?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Thank your honour—all pretty well. Will you please to sit
down? Ours is but a little crowded place, but there is a clean corner.
Set out the chair for his honour, Mary.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> I think everything is very clean. What, John’s in the field, I
suppose?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Yes, sir, with his two eldest sons, sowing and harrowing.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Well, and here are two, three, four, six; all the rest of your
stock, I suppose.—All as busy as bees!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Ay, your honour! These are not times to be idle in. John and
I have always worked hard, and we bring up our children to work too.
There’s none of them, except the youngest, but can do something.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> You do very rightly. With industry and sobriety there is no
fear of their getting a living, come what may. I wish many gentlemen’s
children had as good a chance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span><em>Bet.</em> Lord! sir, if they have fortunes ready got for them, what need
they care?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> But fortunes are easier to spend than to get; and when they
are at the bottom of the purse, what must they do to fill it again?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Nay, that’s true, sir; and we have reason enough to be thankful,
that we are able and willing to work, and have a good landlord to live
under.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Good tenants deserve good landlords; and I have been long
acquainted with your value. Come, little folks, I have brought something
for you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Why don’t you thank his honour?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> I did not think you had a daughter so old as that young woman.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> No more I have, sir. She is not my own daughter, though she is
as good as one to me.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Some relation, then, I suppose?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> No, sir, none at all.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Who is she, then?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> (<em>whispering</em>). When she is gone out, I will tell your honour.—(<em>aloud.</em>)
Go, Fanny, and take some milk to the young calf in the stable.</p>

<div class='c017'>[<em>Exit</em> Fanny.</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> A pretty modest-looking young woman, on my word!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Ay, sir—and as good as she is pretty. You must know, sir, that
this young woman is a stranger from a great way off. She came here
quite by accident, and has lived with us above a twelvemonth. I’ll tell
your honour all about it if you choose.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Pray do—I am curious to hear it. But first favour me with a
draught of your whey.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> I beg your pardon, sir, for not offering it. Run, Mary, and fetch
his honour some fresh whey in a clean basin.</p>
<div class='c017'>[Mary <em>goes</em>.</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Now, pray, begin your story.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Well, sir—As our John was coming from work one evening, he
saw at some distance on the road a carrier’s wagon overturned. He ran
up to help, and found a poor old gentlewoman lying on the back much
hurt, and this girl sitting beside her, crying. My good man, after he had
helped in setting the wagon to rights, went to them, and with a good deal
of difficulty got the gentlewoman into the wagon again, and walked by the
side of it to our house. He called me out and we got something comfortable
for her; but she was so ill that she could not bear to be carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>farther. So after consulting a while, we took her into the house, and put
her to bed. Her head was sadly hurt, and she seemed to grow worse
instead of better. We got a doctor to her, and did our best to nurse her,
but all would not do, and we soon found she was likely to die. Poor
Fanny, her grand-daughter, never left her day or night; and it would
have gone to your honour’s heart, to have heard the pitiful moan she made
over her. She was the only friend she had in the world, she said; and
what would become of her if she were to lose her? Fanny’s father and
mother were both dead, and she was going with her grandmother into the
north, where the old gentlewoman came from, to live cheap, and to try to
find out some relations. Well—to make my story short, in a few days the
poor woman died. There was a little more money about her than would
serve to pay her doctor and bury her. Fanny was in sad trouble, indeed.
I thought she would never have left her grandmother’s grave. She cried
and wrung her hands most bitterly. But I tire your honour.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> O no! I am much interested in your story.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> We comforted her as well as we could; but all her cry was,
“What will become of me? Where must I go? Who will take care of
me?” So after a while, said I to John, “Poor creature! my heart grieves
for her. Perhaps she would like to stay with us—though she seems to
have been brought up in a way of living different from ours, too; but what
can she do, left to herself in the wide world!” So my husband agreed
that I should ask her. When I mentioned it to her, poor thing! how her
countenance altered! “O,” said she, “I wish for nothing so much as to stay
and live with you! I am afraid I can do but little to serve you, but indeed
I will learn to do my best.” Said I: “Do no more than you like; you are
welcome to stay and partake with us as long as you please.” Well, sir!
she stayed with us; and set about learning to do all kind of our work with
such good-will, and so handily, that she soon became my best helper.
And she is so sweet-tempered, and so fond of us and the children, that I
love her as well as if she was my own child. She has been well brought
up, I am sure. She can read, and write, and work with her needle, a
great deal better than we can, and when work is over, she teaches the
children. Then she is extraordinarily well-behaved, so as to be admired
by all that see her.—So your honour has now the story of our Fanny.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> I thank you heartily for it, my good Betty! It does much credit
both to you and Fanny. But pray, what is her surname?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> It is—let me see—I think it is Welford.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span><em>Land.</em> Welford! that is a name I am acquainted with. I should be
glad to talk with her a little.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> I will call her in then.</p>
<div class='c017'>[<em>Enter</em> Fanny.</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Come hither, young woman; I have heard your story, and been
much interested by it. You are an orphan, I find.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fanny.</em> Yes, sir; a poor orphan.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Your name is Welford?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> It is, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Where did your parents live?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> In London, sir; but they died when I was very young, and I
went to my grandmother’s in Surrey.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Was she your father’s mother? You will excuse my questions.
I do not ask from idle curiosity.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> She was, sir; and had been long a widow.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Do you know what her maiden name was?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> It was Borrowdale, sir.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Borrowdale!—And pray, whither were you going when the
unfortunate accident happened?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> To Kendal in Westmoreland, sir, near which my grandmother
was born.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Ah! ‘tis the very same—every circumstance corresponds! My
dear Fanny (<em>taking her hand</em>), you have found a relation when you little
thought of it. I am your kinsman. My mother was a Borrowdale, of
Westmoreland, and half-sister to your grandmother. I have heard of all
your parentage; and I remember the death of your poor father, who was
a very honest ingenious artist: and of your mother soon after, of a broken
heart. I could never discover what family they left, nor what was become
of my kinswoman. But I rejoice I have found you out in this extraordinary
manner. You must come and live with me. My wife and daughters will
be very glad to receive one whose conduct has done her so much credit.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> I am much obliged to you, sir, for your kindness; but I am too
mean a person to live as a relation in a family like yours.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> O no! you will not find us of that sort who despise worthy people
for being low in the world; and your language and actions show that you
have been well brought up.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> My poor grandmother, sir, was so kind as to give me all the
education in her power; and if I have not somewhat benefited by her
example and instructions, it must have been my own fault.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span><em>Land.</em> You speak very well, and I feel more attached to you, the more
I hear you.—Well, you must prepare to come home with me. I will take
care to make proper acknowledgments to the good people here who have
been so kind to you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> My dear Fanny, I am heartily glad of your good fortune, but we
shall all be sorry to part with you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> I am sure, my dear friend and mistress, I shall be sorry too. You
received me when I had no other friend in the world, and you treated me
like your own child. I can never forget what I owe you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Enter</em> John, <em>and his eldest son</em> Thomas.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Is your honour here?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Yes, John; and I have found something worth coming for.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> What is that, sir?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> A relation, John. This young woman whom you have so kindly
entertained, is my kinswoman.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> What—our Fanny?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thomas.</em> Fanny!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Yes, indeed. And, after thanking you for your kindness to her
and her poor grandmother, I mean to take her home for a companion to
my wife and daughters.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> This is wonderful news, indeed! Well, Fanny, I am very glad
you have got such a home to go to—you are worthy of it—but we shall
miss you much here.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> So I have been telling her.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thom.</em> (<em>aside to</em> Fanny). What, will you leave us, Fanny? Must
we part?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> (<em>aside to him</em>). What can I do, Thomas?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> There seems some unwillingness to part, I see, on more sides
than one.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Indeed, sir, I believe there is. We have lived very happily
together.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thom.</em> (<em>aside to Fanny</em>). I see we must part with you, but I hope—Surely
you won’t quite forget us?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> (<em>to him</em>). You distress me, Thomas. Forget you! O no!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Come, I see there is something between the young folks that
ought to be spoken about plainly. Do you explain it, Betty.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Why, your honour knows, we could not tell that Fanny was your
relation. So, as my son Thomas and she seemed to take a liking to one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>another, and she was such a clever girl, we did not object to their thinking
about making a match of it, as soon as he should be settled in a farm.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> But that must be over now.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thom.</em> Why so, father?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Why; you can’t think of his honour’s kinswoman.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Come, Fanny, do you decide this affair.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> Sir, Thomas offered me his service when he thought me a poor
friendless girl, and I might think myself favoured by his notice. He
gained my good will, which no change of circumstances can make me
withdraw. It is my determination to join my lot with his, be it what it
may.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thom.</em> My dearest Fanny!</p>
<div class='c017'>[<em>Taking her hand.</em></div>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> You act nobly, my dear girl, and make me proud of my relation.
You shall have my free consent, and something handsome into the
bargain.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> Heaven bless your honour! I know it would have been a heartbreaking
to my poor boy to have parted with her. Dear Fanny!</p>

<div class='c017'>[<em>Kisses her.</em></div>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> I have a farm just now vacant. Thomas shall take it, and
Fanny’s portion shall stock it for him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thom.</em> I humbly thank your honour.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> I thank you too, sir, for us all.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> Sir, since you have been so indulgent in this matter, give me
leave to request you to be satisfied with my paying my duty to the ladies,
without going to live in a way so different from what I have been used
to, and must live in hereafter. I think I can be nowhere better than with
my friends and future parents here.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Your request, Fanny, has so much propriety and good sense in
it, that I cannot refuse it. However, you must suffer us to improve our
acquaintance. I assure you it will give me particular pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> Sir, you will always command my most grateful obedience.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Land.</em> Well—let Thomas bring you to my house this afternoon, and I
will introduce you to your relations, and we will talk over matters.
Farewell, my dear! Nay, I must have a kiss.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> I will wait on you, sir.</p>
<div class='c017'>[<em>Exit Landlord.</em></div>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> My dear Fanny—daughter I may now call you—you cannot think
how much I feel obliged to you.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Thom.</em> But who is so much obliged as I am?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span><em>Fan.</em> Do you not all deserve everything from me?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>John.</em> Well, who could have thought when I went to help up the
wagon, that it would have brought so much good luck to us?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Bet.</em> A good deed is never lost they say.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fan.</em> It shall be the business of my life to prove that this has not been
lost.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>ON EMBLEMS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Pray, papa,” said Cecilia, “what is an <em>emblem</em>? I have met with the
word in my lesson to-day, and I do not quite understand it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An emblem, my dear,” replied he, “is a visible image of an invisible
thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cecilia.</em> A visible image of—I can hardly comprehend—</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well, I will explain it more at length. There are certain notions
that we form in our minds without the help of our eyes or any of our
senses. Thus, Virtue, Vice, Honour, Disgrace, Time, Death, and the
like, are not sensible objects, but ideas of the understanding.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Yes—We cannot feel them or see them, but we can think about
them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True. Now it sometimes happens that we wish to represent one
of these in a visible form; that is, to offer something to the sight that
shall raise a similar notion in the minds of the beholders. In order to do
this, we must take some action or circumstance belonging to it, capable
of being expressed by painting or sculpture, and this is called a <em>type</em> or
<em>emblem</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> But how can this be done?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> I will tell you by an example. You know the sessions-house,
where trials are held. It would be easy to write over the door in order
to distinguish it, “This is the sessions-house;” but it is a more ingenious
and elegant way of pointing it out, to place upon the building a figure
representing the purpose for which it was erected, namely, to distribute
<em>justice</em>. For this end the notion of justice is to be <em>personified</em>, that is,
changed from an idea of the understanding into one of the sight. A
human figure is therefore made, distinguished by tokens which bear a
relation to the character of that virtue. Justice carefully <em>weighs</em> both
sides of a cause; she is therefore represented as holding a <em>pair of
scales</em>. It is her office to <em>punish</em> crimes; she therefore bears a <em>sword</em>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>This is then an <em>emblematical figure</em>, and the sword and scales are
<em>emblems</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I understand this very well. But why is she blindfolded?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> To denote her impartiality—that she decides only from the merits
of the case, and not from a view of the parties.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> How can she weigh anything, though, when her eyes are blinded?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well objected. These are two inconsistent emblems; each proper
in itself, but when used together, making a contradictory action. An
artist of judgment will therefore drop one of them; and accordingly the
best modern figures of Justice have the balance and sword, without the
bandage over the eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Is there not the same fault in making Cupid blindfolded, and yet
putting a bow and arrow into his hands?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> There is. It is a gross absurdity, and not countenanced by the
ancient descriptions of Cupid, who is represented as the surest of all
archers.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I have a figure of <em>Death</em> in my fable-book. I suppose that is
emblematical?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Certainly, or you could not know that it meant Death. How is it
represented?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> He is nothing but bones, and he holds a scythe in one hand, and
an hour-glass in the other.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well—how do you interpret these emblems?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I suppose he is all bones, because nothing but bones are left after
a dead body has lain long in the grave.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True. This, however, is not so properly an emblem, as the real
and visible effect of death. But the scythe?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Is not that because death mows down everything?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It is. No instrument could so properly represent the wide-wasting
sway of death, which sweeps down the race of animals like flowers falling
under the hands of the mower. It is a simile used in the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> The hour-glass, I suppose, is to show people their time is come.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Right. In the hour-glass that Death holds, all the sand is run
out from the upper to the lower part. Have you never observed upon a
monument an old figure, with wings, and a scythe, and with his head
bald all but a single lock before?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> O yes;—and I have been told it is <em>Time</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well—and what do you make of it? Why is he old?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span><em>Cec.</em> O! because he has lasted a long while.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> And why has he wings?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Because Time is swift, and flies away.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> What does his scythe mean?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I suppose it is because he destroys and cuts down everything,
like Death.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True. I think, however, a weapon rather slower in operation, as
a pick-axe, would have been more suitable to the gradual action of time.
But what is his single lock of hair for?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I have been thinking, and cannot make it out.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> I thought that would puzzle you. It relates to time as giving
<em>opportunity</em> for doing anything. It is to be seized as it presents itself, or
it will escape, and cannot be recovered. Thus the proverb says, “Take
Time by the forelock.” Well—now you understand what emblems are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Yes, I think I do. I suppose the painted sugar-loaves over the
grocer’s shop, and the mortar over the apothecary’s, are emblems, too?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Not so properly. They are only the pictures of things which are
themselves the objects of sight, as the real sugar-loaf in the shop of the
grocer, and the real mortar in that of the apothecary. However, an
implement belonging to a particular rank or profession is commonly used
as an emblem to point out the man exercising that rank or profession.
Thus, a crown is considered as an emblem of a king; a sword, or spear,
of a soldier; an anchor, of a sailor; and the like.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I remember Captain Heartwell, when he came to see us, had the
figure of an anchor on all his buttons.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> He had. That was the emblem or badge of his belonging to the navy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> But you told me that an emblem was a visible sign of an invisible
thing; yet a sea-captain is not an invisible thing.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> He is not invisible as a man, but his profession is invisible.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I do not well understand that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Profession is a <em>quality</em>, belonging equally to a number of individuals,
however different they may be in external form and appearance. It may
be added or taken away without any visible change. Thus, if Captain
Heartwell were to give up his commission, he would appear to you the
same man as before. It is plain, therefore, that what in that case he had
lost, namely, his profession, was a thing invisible. It is one of those ideas
of the understanding which I before mentioned to you as different from a
sensible idea.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span><em>Cec.</em> I comprehend it now.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> I have got here a few emblematical pictures. Suppose you try
whether you can find out their meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> O yes—I shall like that very well.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Here is a man standing on the summit of a steep cliff, and going
to ascend a ladder which he has planted against a cloud.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Let me see!—that must be <em>Ambition</em>, I think.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> How do you explain it?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> He is got very high already, but he wants to be still higher; so
he ventures up the ladder, though it is only supported by a cloud, and
hangs over a precipice.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Very right. Here is now another man, hood-winked, who is
crossing a raging torrent upon stepping-stones.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Then he will certainly fall in. I suppose he is one that runs into
danger without considering whither he is going?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yes; and you may call him <em>Fool-hardiness</em>. Do you see this hand
coming out of a black cloud, and putting an extinguisher upon a lamp?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I do. If that lamp be the lamp of life, the hand that extinguishes
it must be <em>Death</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Very just. Here is an old, half-ruined building, supported by
props; and the figure of Time is sawing through one of the props.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> That must be <em>Old Age</em>, surely.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It is. The next is a man leaning upon a breaking crutch.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I don’t well know what to make of that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It is intended for <em>Instability</em>; however, it might also stand for
<em>False Confidence</em>. Here is a man poring over a sundial with a candle in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I am at a loss for that, too.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Consider—a sundial is only made to tell the hour by the light of
the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Then this man must know nothing about it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True; and his name is therefore <em>Ignorance</em>. Here is a walking-stick,
the lower part of which is set in the water, and it appears crooked.
What does that denote?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Is the stick really crooked?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> No; but it is the property of water to give that appearance.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Then it must signify <em>Deception</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It does. I dare say you will at once know this fellow who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>is running as fast as his legs will carry him, and looking back at his
shadow.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> He must be <em>Fear</em> or <em>Terror</em>, I fancy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yes; you may call him which you please. But who is this sower,
that scatters seeds in the ground?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> Let me consider. I think there is a parable in the Bible about
seed sown, and it therefore signifies something like <em>Instruction</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True; but it may also represent <em>Hope</em>, for no one sows without
hoping to reap the fruit. What do you think of this candle held before a
mirror, in which its figure is exactly reflected?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I do not know what it means.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It represents <em>Truth</em>; the essence of which consists in the fidelity
with which objects are received and reflected back by our minds. The
object is here a luminous one, to show the clearness and brightness of
Truth. Here is next an upright column, the perfect straightness of which
is shown by a plumb-line hanging from its summit, and exactly parallel
to the side of the column.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> I suppose that must represent <em>Uprightness</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yes—or in other words, <em>Rectitude</em>. The strength and stability of the
pillar alone denote the security produced by this virtue. You see here a
woman disentangling and reeling off a very perplexed skein of thread.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> She must have a great deal of patience.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True. She is <em>Patience</em> herself. The brooding hen, sitting beside
her, is another emblem of the same quality that aids the interpretation.
Who do you think this pleasing female is, that looks with such kindness
upon the drooping plant she is watering?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> That must be <em>Charity</em>, I believe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It is; or you may call her <em>Benignity</em>, which is nearly the same
thing. Here is a lady sitting demurely, with one finger on her lip, while
she holds a bridle in her other hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> The finger on the lip, I suppose, denotes Silence. The bridle
must mean confinement. I should almost fancy her to be a schoolmistress.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Ha! ha! I hope, indeed, many schoolmistresses are endued with
her spirit, for she is <em>Prudence</em> or <em>Discretion</em>. Well—we are now got to
the end of our pictures, and upon the whole you have interpreted them
very prettily.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> But I have one question to ask you, papa. In these pictures and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>others that I have seen of the same sort, almost all the <em>good</em> qualities are
represented in the form of <em>women</em>. What is the reason of that?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It is certainly a compliment, my dear, either to your sex’s person
or mind. The inventor either chose the figure of a female to clothe each
agreeable quality in, because he thought that the most agreeable form, and
therefore best suited it; or he meant to imply that the female character is
really the most virtuous and amiable. I rather believe that the first was
his intention, but I shall not object to your taking it in the light of the
second.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> But is it true—is it true?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Why, I can give you very good authority for the preference of the
female sex, in a moral view. One Ledyard, a great traveller, who had
walked through almost all the countries of Europe, and at last died in an
expedition to explore the internal parts of Africa, gave a most decisive
and pleasing testimony in favour of the superior character of women,
whether savage or civilized. I was so much pleased with it, that I put
great part of it into verse; and if it will not make you vain, I will give
you a copy of my lines.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cec.</em> O, pray, do!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Here they are. Read them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>GENEROUS REVENGE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>At the period when the republic of Genoa was divided between the
factions of the nobles and the people, Uberto, a man of low origin, but
of an elevated mind and superior talents, and enriched by commerce,
having raised himself to be the head of a popular party, maintained for a
considerable time a democratic form of government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nobles, at length, uniting all their efforts, succeeded in subverting
this state of things, and regained their former supremacy. They used
their victory with considerable rigour; and in particular having imprisoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Uberto, proceeded against him as a traitor, and thought they displayed
sufficient lenity in passing a sentence upon him of perpetual banishment,
and the confiscation of all his property. Adorno, who was then possessed
of the first magistracy, a man haughty in temper, and proud of ancient
nobility, though otherwise not void of generous sentiments, in pronouncing
this sentence on Uberto, aggravated its severity by the insolent terms in
which he conveyed it. “You,” said he,—“you, the son of a base mechanic,
who have dared to trample upon the nobles of Genoa—you, by their
clemency, are only doomed to shrink again into the nothingness whence
you sprung.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Uberto received his condemnation with respectful submission to the
court; yet stung by the manner in which it was expressed, he could not
forbear saying to Adorno, that “perhaps he might hereafter find cause to
repent the language he had used to a man capable of sentiments as elevated
as his own.” He then made his obeisance and retired; and after taking
leave of his friends, embarked in a vessel bound for Naples, and quitted
his native country without a tear.</p>

<p class='c000'>He collected some debts due to him in the Neapolitan dominions, and
with the wreck of his fortune went to settle on one of the islands in the
Archipelago belonging to the state of Venice. Here his industry and
capacity in mercantile pursuits raised him, in a course of years, to greater
wealth than he had possessed in his most prosperous days at Genoa; and
his reputation for honour and generosity equalled his fortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among other places which he frequently visited as a merchant, was the
city of Tunis, at that time in friendship with the Venetians, though hostile
to most of the other Italian states, and especially to Genoa. As Uberto
was on a visit to one of the first men of that place at his country-house,
he saw a young Christian slave at work in irons, whose appearance excited
his attention. The youth seemed oppressed with labour, to which his
delicate frame had not been accustomed, and while he leaned at intervals
upon the instrument with which he was working, a sigh burst from his
full heart, and a tear stole down his cheek. Uberto eyed him with tender
compassion, and addressed him in Italian. The youth eagerly caught the
sounds of his native tongue, and replying to his inquiries, informed him
he was a Genoese. “And what is your name, young man?” said Uberto.
“You need not be afraid of confessing to <em>me</em> your birth and condition.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Alas!” he answered, “I fear my captors already suspect enough to
demand a large ransom. My father is indeed one of the first men in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Genoa. His name is Adorno, and I am his only son.”—“Adorno!”
Uberto checked himself from uttering more aloud, but to himself he cried,
“Thank Heaven! then I shall be nobly revenged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took leave of the youth, and immediately went to inquire after the
corsair captain who claimed a right in young Adorno, and having found
him, demanded the price of his ransom. He learned that he was considered
as a captive of value, and that less than two thousand crowns would
not be accepted. Uberto paid the sum; and causing his servant to follow
him with a horse and a complete suit of handsome apparel, he returned to
the youth, who was working as before, and told him he was free. With
his own hands he took off his fetters, and helped him to change his dress,
and mount on horseback. The youth was tempted to think it all a dream,
and the flutter of emotion almost deprived him of the power of returning
thanks to his generous benefactor. He was soon, however, convinced of
the reality of his good fortune, by sharing the lodging and table of Uberto.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a stay of some days at Tunis to despatch the remainder of his
business, Uberto departed homeward accompanied by young Adorno, who
by his pleasing manners had highly ingratiated himself with him. Uberto
kept him some time at his house, treating him with all the respect and
affection he could have shown for the son of his dearest friend. At length,
having a safe opportunity of sending him to Genoa, he gave him a faithful
servant for a conductor, fitted him out with every convenience, slipped
a purse of gold into one hand, and a letter into the other, and thus
addressed him:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear youth, I could with much pleasure detain you longer in my
humble mansion, but I feel your impatience to revisit your friends, and I
am sensible that it would be cruelty to deprive them longer than necessary
of the joy they will receive in recovering you. Deign to accept this
provision for your voyage, and deliver this letter to your father. <em>He</em>
probably may recollect something of me, though you are too young to do
so. Farewell; I shall not soon forget you, and I hope you will not forget
me.” Adorno poured out the effusions of a grateful and affectionate heart,
and they parted with mutual tears and embraces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man had a prosperous voyage home; and the transport with
which he was again beheld by his almost heart-broken parents may more
easily be conceived than described. After learning that he had been a
captive in Tunis, (for it was supposed that the ship in which he sailed
had foundered at sea,) “And to whom,” said old Adorno, “am I indebted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>for the inestimable benefit of restoring you to my arms?”—“This letter,”
said his son, “will inform you.” He opened it, and read as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“That son of a vile mechanic, who told you that one day you might
repent the scorn with which you treated him, has the satisfaction of seeing
his prediction accomplished. For know, proud noble! that the deliverer
of your only son from slavery is</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<em>The banished</em> <span class='sc'>Uberto</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Adorno dropped the letter and covered his face with his hand, while
his son was displaying in the warmest language of gratitude the virtues
of Uberto, and the truly paternal kindness he had experienced from him.
As the debt could not be cancelled, Adorno resolved if possible to repay
it. He made such powerful intercessions with the other nobles, that the
sentence pronounced on Uberto was reversed, and full permission given
him to return to Genoa. In apprizing him of this event, Adorno expressed
his sense of the obligations he lay under to him, acknowledged the genuine
nobleness of his character, and requested his friendship. Uberto returned
to his country, and closed his days in peace, with the universal esteem
of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE POWER OF HABIT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>William was one day reading in a book of travels to his father, when
he came to the following relation:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Andes in South America are the highest ridge of mountains in
the known world. There is a road over them, on which, about halfway
between the summit and the foot, is a house of entertainment, where it is
common for travellers in their ascent and descent to meet. The difference
of their feelings upon the same spot is very remarkable. Those who
are descending the mountain are melting with heat, so that they can
scarcely bear any clothes upon them; while those who are ascending
shiver with cold, and wrap themselves up in the warmest garments they
have.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How strange this is!” cried William; “What can be the reason
of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is,” replied his father, “a striking instance of the <em>power of habit</em>
over the body. The cold is so intense on the top of these mountains, that
it is as much as travellers can do to keep themselves from being frozen to
death. Their bodies, therefore, become so habituated to the sensation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>cold, that every diminution of it as they descend seems to them a degree
of actual heat; and when they are got halfway down, they feel as if they
were quite in a sultry climate. On the other hand the valleys at the foot
of the mountains are so excessively hot, that the body becomes relaxed,
and sensible to the slightest degree of cold; so that when a traveller
ascends from them toward the hills, the middle regions appear quite
inclement from their coldness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And does the same thing,” rejoined William, “always happen in
crossing high mountains?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It does,” returned his father, “in a degree proportioned to their height,
and the time taken in crossing them. Indeed, a short time is sufficient to
produce similar effects. Let one boy have been playing at rolling snowballs,
and another have been roasting himself before a great fire, and let
them meet in the porch of the house;—if you ask them how they feel, I
will answer for it you will find them as different in their accounts as the
travellers on the Andes. But this is only one example of the operation
of a universal principle belonging to human nature: for the power of
habit is the same thing whatever be the circumstance which calls it forth,
whether relating to the mind or the body.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may consider the story you have been reading as a sort of simile
or parable. The central station on the mountain may be compared to
<em>middle life</em>. With what different feelings is this regarded by those who
bask in the sunshine of opulence, and those who shrink under the cold
blast of penury!</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suppose the wealthy duke, our neighbour, were suddenly obliged to
descend to our level, and live as we do—to part with all his carriages,
sell his coach-horses, and hunters, quit his noble seat with its fine park
and gardens, dismiss all his train of servants except two or three, and
take a house like ours; what a dreadful fall it would seem to him! how
wretched it would probably make him, and how much would he be pitied
by the world!</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the other hand, suppose the labourer who lives in the next cottage
were unexpectedly to fall heir to an estate of a few hundreds a year, and
in consequence to get around him all the comforts and conveniences that
we possess—a commodious house to inhabit, good clothes to wear, plenty
of wholesome food and firing, servants to do all the drudgery of the family
and the like;—how all his acquaintance would congratulate him, and
what a paradise would he seem to himself to be got into! Yet he, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>the duke, and ourselves, are equally <em>men</em>, made liable by nature to the
same desires and necessities, and perhaps all equally strong in constitution,
and equally capable of supporting hardships. Is not this fully as wonderful
a difference in feeling as that on crossing the Andes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed it is,” said William.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the cause of it must be exactly the same—the influence of habit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of what importance then must it be toward a happy life, to regulate
our habits so, that in the possible changes of this world we may be more
likely to be gainers than losers!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how can this be done? Would it be right for the duke to live
like us, or us like the labourer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly not. But to apply the case to persons of our middle condition,
I would have us use our advantages in such a frugal manner, as to
make them as little as possible essential to our happiness, should fortune
sink us to a lower station. For as to the chance of rising to a higher,
there is no need to prepare our habits for that—we should readily enough
accommodate our feelings to such a change. To be pleased and satisfied
with simple food, to accustom ourselves not to shrink from the inclemencies
of the seasons—to avoid indolence, and take delight in some useful
employment of the mind or body, to do as much as we can for ourselves,
and not expect to be waited upon on every small occasion—these are the
habits which will make us in some measure independent of fortune, and
secure us a moderate degree of enjoyment under every change short of
absolute want. I will tell you a story to this purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A London merchant had two sons, James and Richard. James, from
a boy, accustomed himself to every indulgence in his power, and when
he grew up, was quite a fine gentleman. He dressed expensively, frequented
public diversions, kept his hunter at a livery stable, and was a member of
several convivial clubs. At home, it was almost a footman’s sole business
to wait on him. He would have thought it greatly beneath him to buckle
his own shoes; and if he wanted anything at the other end of the room,
he would ring the bell, and bring the servant up two pair of stairs, rather
than rise from his chair to fetch it. He did a little business in the counting-house
on forenoons, but devoted all his time after dinner to indolence and
amusement.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Richard was a different character. He was plain in his appearance,
and domestic in his way of life. He gave as little trouble as possible, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>would have been ashamed to ask assistance in doing what he could easily
do for himself. He was assiduous in business, and employed his leisure
hours chiefly in reading and acquiring useful knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Both were still young and unsettled when their father died, leaving
behind him a very trifling property. As the young men had not capital
sufficient to follow the same line of mercantile business in which he had
been engaged, they were obliged to look out for a new plan of maintenance,
and a great reduction of expense was the first thing requisite. This was
a severe stroke to James, who found himself at once cut off from all the
pleasures and indulgences to which he was so habituated, that he thought
life of no value without them. He grew melancholy and dejected,
hazarded all his little property in lottery tickets, and was quite beggared.
Still, unable to think of retrieving himself by industry and frugality, he
accepted a commission in a new-raised regiment ordered for the West
Indies, where, soon after his arrival, he caught a fever and died.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Richard, in the meantime, whose comforts were little impaired by his
change of situation, preserved his cheerfulness, and found no difficulty in
accommodating himself to his fortune. He engaged himself as a clerk
in a house his father had been connected with, and lived as frugally as
possible upon his salary. It furnished him with decent board, lodging,
and clothing, which was all he required, and his hours of leisure were
nearly as many as before. A book or a sober friend always sufficed to
procure him an agreeable evening. He gradually rose in the confidence
of his employers, who increased from time to time his salary and
emoluments. Every increase was a source of gratification to him, because
he was able to enjoy pleasures which, however, habit had not made
necessary to his comfort. In process of time he was enabled to settle for
himself, and passed through life in the enjoyment of that modest competence
which best suited his disposition.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE COST OF A WAR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“You may remember, Oswald,” said Mr. B. to his son, “that I gave
you some time ago a notion of <em>the price of a victory</em> to the poor souls
engaged in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall not soon forget it, I assure you, sir,” replied Oswald.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Father.</em> Very well; I mean now to give you some idea <em>of the cost of
a war</em> to the people among whom it is carried on. This may serve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>to abate something of the admiration with which historians are to apt to
inspire us for great warriors and conquerors. You have heard, I doubt
not, of Louis the Fourteenth, king of France?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Oswald.</em> Oh, yes!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> He was entitled by his subjects <em>Louis le Grand</em>, and was compared
by them to the Cesars and Alexanders of antiquity; and with some
justice as to the extent of his power, and the use he made of it. He was
the most potent prince of his time; commanded mighty and victorious
armies; and enlarged the limits of his hereditary dominions. Louis was
not naturally a hard-hearted man; but having been taught from his cradle
that everything ought to give way to the interests of his glory, and that
this glory consisted in domineering over his neighbours, and making
conquests, he grew to be insensible to all the miseries brought on his own
and other people, in pursuit of this noble design, as he thought it.
Moreover, he was plunged in dissolute pleasures, and the delights of pomp
and splendour, from his youth; and he was ever surrounded by a tribe of
abject flatterers, who made him believe that he had a full right, in all
cases to do as he pleased. Conquest abroad and pleasure at home, were
therefore the chief business of his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>One evening, his minister, Louvois, came to him and said, “Sire, it is
absolutely necessary to make a desert of the <em>Palatinate</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a country in Germany, on the banks of the Rhine, one of the
most populous and best-cultivated districts in that empire, filled with
towns and villages, and industrious inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should be sorry to do it,” replied the king, “for you know how much
odium we acquired throughout Europe when a part of it was laid waste
sometime ago, under Marshal Turenne.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It cannot be helped, sire,” returned Louvois. “All the damage he
did has been repaired, and the country is as flourishing as ever. If we
leave it in its present state it will afford quarters to your majesty’s
enemies, and endanger your conquests. It must be entirely ruined—the
good of the service will not permit it to be otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, then,” answered Louis, “if it must be so, you are to give orders
accordingly.” So saying, he left the cabinet, and went to assist a magnificent
festival given in honour of his favourite mistress by a prince of
the blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pitiless Louvois lost no time; but despatched a courier that very
night, with positive orders to the French generals in the Palatinate to carry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>fire and desolation through the whole country—not to leave a house or a
tree standing—and to expel all the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the midst of a rigorous winter.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> O horrible! but surely the generals would not obey such orders?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> What, a general disobey the commands of his sovereign!—That
would be contrary to every maxim of the <em>trade</em>. Right and wrong are no
considerations to a military man. He is only to do as he is bid. The
French generals who were upon the spot, and must see with their own
eyes all that was done, probably felt somewhat like men on the occasion;
but the sacrifice to their duty as soldiers was so much the greater. The
commands were peremptory, and they were obeyed to a tittle. Towns
and villages were burnt to the ground; vineyards and orchards were cut
down and rooted up; sheep and cattle were killed; all the fair works of
ages were destroyed in a moment; and the smiling face of culture was
turned to a dreary waste.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor inhabitants were driven from their warm and comfortable
habitations into the open fields, to confront all the inclemencies of the
season. Their furniture was burnt or pillaged, and nothing was left them
but the clothes on their backs, and the few necessaries they could carry
with them. The roads were covered with trembling fugitives, going
they knew not whither, shivering with cold and pinched with hunger.
Here an old man, dropping with fatigue, lay down to die—there a woman
with a new-born infant sunk perishing on the snow, while her husband
hung over them in all the horror of despair.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> O, what a scene! Poor creatures! What became of them at last?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Such of them as did not perish on the road got to the neighbouring
towns, where they were received with all the hospitality that such
calamitous times would afford; but they were beggared for life. Meantime,
their country for many a league round displayed no other sight than
that of black smoking ruins in the midst of silence and desolation.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> I hope, however, that such things do not often happen in war.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Not often, perhaps, to the same extent: but in some degree they
must take place in every war. A village which would afford a favourable
post to the enemy is always burnt without hesitation. A country which
can no longer be maintained, is cleared of all its provision and forage
before it is abandoned, lest the enemy should have the advantage
of them; and the poor inhabitants are left to subsist as they can. Crops
of corn are trampled down by armies in their march, or devoured while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>green as fodder for their horses. Pillage, robbery and murder, are always
going on in the outskirts of the best-disciplined camp. Then consider
what must happen in every siege. On the first approach of the enemy,
all the buildings in the suburbs of a town are demolished, and all the
trees in gardens and public walks are cut down, lest they should afford
shelter to the besiegers. As the siege goes on, bombs, hot balls, and
cannon-shot, are continually flying about; by which the greatest part of a
town is ruined or laid in ashes, and many of the innocent people killed
or maimed. If the resistance is obstinate, famine and pestilence are
sure to take place; and if the garrison holds out to the last, and the town
is taken by storm, it is generally given up to be pillaged by the enraged
and licentious soldiery.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be easy to bring too many examples of cruelty exercised upon
a conquered country, even in very late times, when war is said to be
carried on with so much humanity; but, indeed, how can it be otherwise?
The art of war is essentially that of destruction, and it is impossible there
should be a mild and merciful way of murdering and ruining one’s fellow-creatures.
Soldiers, as men, are often humane; but war must ever be
cruel. Though Homer has filled his Iliad with the exploits of fighting
heroes, yet he makes Jupiter address Mars, the god of War, in terms of
the utmost abhorrence:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Of all the gods who tread the spangled skies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou most unjust, most odious in our eyes;</div>
      <div class='line'>In human discord is thy dire delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>The waste of slaughter, and the rage of fight:</div>
      <div class='line'>No bound, no law, thy fiery temper quells.”—<span class='sc'>Pope.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Os.</em> Surely, as war is so bad a thing, there might be some way of
preventing it.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fa.</em> Alas! I fear mankind have been too long accustomed to it, and it
is too agreeable to their bad passions, easily to be laid aside, whatever
miseries it may bring upon them. But, in the meantime, let us correct our
own ideas of the matter, and no longer lavish admiration upon such a pest
of the human race as a <em>Conqueror</em>, how brilliant soever his qualities may
be; nor ever think that a profession which binds a man to be the servile
instrument of cruelty and injustice is an <em>honourable</em> calling.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>GREAT MEN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>“I will show you a <em>great man</em>,” said Mr. C. one day to his son, at
the time the duke of Bridgewater’s canal was making. He accordingly
took him to a place where several workmen were employed in raising a
prodigious mound, on the top of which the canal was to be carried across
a deep valley. In the midst of them was a very plain-dressed man,
awkward in his gestures, uncouth in his appearance, and rather heavy in
his countenance—in short, a mere countryman like the rest. He had a
plan in his hand and was giving directions to the people around him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>and surveying the whole labour with profound attention. “This, Arthur,”
said Mr. C., “is the <em>great Mr. Brindley</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What,” cried Arthur in surprise, “is that a <em>great man</em>?”</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> Yes, a very great man. Why are you surprised?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> I don’t know, but I should have expected a great man to have looked
very differently.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> It matters little how a man looks, if he can perform great things.
That person, without any advantages of education, has become, by the
force of his own genius, the first engineer of the age. He is doing things
that were never done or even thought of in this country before. He
pierces hills, makes bridges over valleys, and aqueducts across navigable
rivers, and, in short, is likely to change the whole face of the country, and
to introduce improvements the value of which cannot be calculated. When
at a loss how to bring about any of his designs, he does not go to other
people for assistance, but he consults the wonderful faculties of his own
mind, and finds a way to overcome his difficulties. He looks like a rustic
it is true, but he has a soul of the first order, such as is not granted to one
out of millions of the human race.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> But are all men of extraordinary abilities properly <em>great men</em>?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> The word has been variously used; but I would call every one
a great man <em>who does great things by means of his own powers</em>. Great
abilities are often employed about trifles, or indolently wasted without any
considerable exertion at all. To make a great man, the object pursued
should be large and important, and vigour and perseverance should be
employed in the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> All the great men I remember to have read about were kings, or
generals, or prime ministers, or in some high station or other.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> It is natural they should stand foremost in the list of great men,
because the sphere in which they act is an extensive one, and what they
do has a powerful influence over numbers of mankind. Yet those that
invent useful arts, or discover important truths which may promote the
comfort and happiness of unborn generations in the most distant parts of
the world, act a still more important part; and their claim to merit is
generally more undoubted than that of the former, because what they do
is more certainly their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to estimate the real share a man in a high station has had in
the great events which have been attributed to him, strip him in your
imagination of all the external advantages of rank and power, and see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>what a figure he would have made without them; or fancy a common man
put in his place, and judge whether affairs would have gone on in the
same track. Augustus Cesar, and Louis XIV. of France, have both been
called great princes; but deprive them of their crown, and they will both
dwindle into obscure and trivial characters. But no change of circumstances
could reduce Alfred the Great to the level of a common man.
The two former could sink into their graves, and yield their power to a
successor, and scarcely be missed; but Alfred’s death changed the fate of
his kingdom. Thus with Epaminondas fell all the glory and greatness of
the Theban state. He first raised it to consequence, and it could not
survive him.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> Was not Czar Peter a great man?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> I am not sure he deserves that title. Being a despotic prince,
at the head of a vast empire, he could put into execution whatever plans
he was led to adopt, and these plans in general were grand and beneficial
to his country. But the means he used were such as the master of the
lives and fortunes of millions could easily employ, and there was more of
brutal force than of skill and judgment in the manner in which he pursued
his designs. Still he was an <em>extraordinary</em> man; and the resolution of
leaving his throne, in order to acquire in foreign countries the knowledge
necessary to rescue his own from barbarism, was a feature of greatness.
A truly great prince, however, would have employed himself better than
in learning to build boats at Saardam.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> What was Alexander the Great?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> A great conqueror, but not a great man. It was easy for him,
with the well-disciplined army of Greeks which he received from his
father Philip, to overrun the unwarlike kingdoms of Asia, and defeat the
Great King, as the king of Persia was called: but though he showed
some marks of an elevated mind, he seems to have possessed few qualities
which could have raised him to distinction had he been born in an humble
station. Compare his fugitive grandeur, supported by able ministers and
generals, to the power which his tutor the great Aristotle, merely through
the force of his own genius, exercised over men’s minds throughout the
most civilized part of the world for two thousand years after his death.
Compare also the part which has been acted in the world by the Spanish
monarchs, the masters of immense possessions in Europe and America,
to that by Christopher Columbus, the Genoese navigator, who could have
it inscribed on his tombstones that he <em>gave</em> a new world to the kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of Castile and Aragon. These comparisons will teach you to distinguish
between greatness of character and greatness of station, which are too
often confounded. He who governs a great country may in one sense be
called a great king; but this is no more than an appellation belonging to
rank, like that of the Great Mogul, or the Grand Seignor, and infers no
more personal grandeur than the title of Mr. Such-a-one, the Great Grocer,
or Great Brewer.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> Must not great men be good men, too?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> If that man is great who does great things, it will not follow
that goodness must necessarily be one of his qualities, since that chiefly
refers to the end and intentions of actions. Julius Cesar, and Cromwell,
for example, were men capable of the greatest exploits; but directing
them, not to the public good, but to the purposes of their own ambition,
in pursuit of which they violated all the duties of morality, they have
obtained the title of <em>great bad men</em>. A person, however, cannot be great
at all without possessing many virtues. He must be firm, steady, and
diligent, superior to difficulties and dangers, and equally superior to the
allurements of ease and pleasure. For want of these moral qualities,
many persons of exalted minds and great talents have failed to deserve
the title of great men. It is in vain that the French poets and historians
have decorated Henry the Fourth with the name of Great; his facility of
disposition and uncontrollable love of pleasure have caused him to forfeit
his claim to it in the estimation of impartial judges. As power is essential
to greatness, a man cannot be great without <em>power over himself</em>, which
is the highest kind of power.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> After all, is it not better to be a good man than a great one?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> There is more merit in being a good man, because it is what
we make ourselves, whereas the talents that produce greatness are the gift
of nature; though they may be improved by our own efforts, they cannot
be acquired. But if goodness is the proper object of our love and esteem,
greatness deserves our high admiration and respect. This Mr. Brindley
before us is by all accounts a worthy man, but it is not for this reason I
have brought you to see him. I wish you to look upon him as one of
those sublime and uncommon objects of nature which fill the mind with
a certain awe and astonishment. Next to being great oneself, it is
desirable to have a true relish for greatness.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE FOUR SISTERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I am one of four sisters; and having some reason to think myself not
well used either by them or by the world, I beg leave to lay before you a
sketch of our history and characters. You will not wonder there should
be frequent bickerings among us, when I tell you that in our infancy we
were continually fighting; and so great was the noise, and din, and
confusion, in our continual struggles to get uppermost, that it was impossible
for anybody to live among us in such a scene of tumult and
disorder. These brawls, however, by a powerful interposition, were put
an end to; our proper place was assigned to each of us, and we had strict
orders not to encroach on the limits of each other’s property, but to join
our common offices for the good of the whole family.</p>

<p class='c000'>My first sister (I call her the first, because we have generally allowed
her the precedence in rank) is, I must acknowledge, of a very active,
sprightly disposition; quick and lively, and has more brilliancy than any
of us; but she is hot: everything serves for fuel to her fury when it is
once raised to a certain degree, and she is so mischievous whenever she
gets the upper hand, that notwithstanding her aspiring disposition, if I may
freely speak my mind, she is calculated to make a good servant, but a
very bad mistress.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am almost ashamed to mention that, notwithstanding her seeming
delicacy, she has a most voracious appetite, and devours everything that
comes in her way; though, like other eager thin people, she does no
credit to her keeping. Many a time she has consumed the product of my
barns and storehouses, but it is all lost upon her. She has even been
known to get into an oil-shop or tallow-chandler’s, when everybody was
asleep, and lick up with the utmost greediness whatever she found there.
Indeed, all prudent people are aware of her tricks, and though she is
admitted into the best families, they take care to watch her very narrowly.
I should not forget to mention, that my sister was once in a country where
she was treated with uncommon respect; she was lodged in a sumptuous
building, and had a number of young women of the best families to attend
on her, and feed her, and watch over her health: in short, she was looked
upon as something more than a common mortal. But she always behaved
with great severity to her maids, and if any of them were negligent of
their duty, or made a slip in their own conduct, nothing would serve her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>but burying the poor girls alive. I have myself had some dark hints and
intimations from the most respectable authority, that she will some time
or other make an end of me. You need not wonder, therefore, if I am
jealous of her motions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next sister I shall mention to you has so far the appearance of
modesty and humility, that she generally seeks the lowest place. She is
indeed of a very yielding easy temper, generally cool, and often wears a
sweet placid smile upon her countenance; but she is easily ruffled, and
when worked up, as she often is, by another sister, whom I shall mention
to you by-and-by, she becomes a perfect fury. Indeed, she is so apt to
swell with sudden gusts of passion, that she is suspected at times to be a
little lunatic. Between her and my first-mentioned sister, there is a more
settled antipathy than between the Theban pair; and they never meet
without making efforts to destroy one another. With me she is always
ready to form the most intimate union, but it is not always to my advantage.
There goes a story in our family, that when we were all young, she once
attempted to drown me. She actually kept me under water a considerable
time, and though at length I got my head above water, my constitution
is generally thought to have been essentially injured by it ever since.
From that time she has made no such atrocious attempt, but she is continually
making encroachments upon my property, and even when she
appears most gentle, she is very insidious, and has such an undermining
way with her, that her insinuating arts are as much to be dreaded as open
violence. I might indeed remonstrate, but it is a known part of her
character, that nothing makes any lasting impression upon her.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to my third sister, I have already mentioned the ill office she does
me with my last-mentioned one, who is entirely under her influence. She
is besides of a very uncertain, variable temper, sometimes hot, and sometimes
cold, nobody knows where to have her. Her lightness is ever
proverbial, and she has nothing to give those who live with her more
substantial than the smiles of courtiers. I must add, that she keeps in
her service three or four rough blustering bullies, with puffed cheeks, who
when they are let loose, think they have nothing to do but drive the world
before them. She sometimes joins with my first sister, and their violence
occasionally throws me into such a trembling, that, though naturally of a
firm constitution, I shake as if I was in an ague fit.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to myself, I am of a steady, solid temper; not shining, indeed, but
kind and liberal, quite a Lady Bountiful. Every one tastes of my beneficence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>and I am of so grateful a disposition, that I have been known to
return a hundred-fold for any present that has been made me. I feed and
clothe all my children, and afford a welcome home to the wretch who has
no other. I bear with unrepining patience all manner of ill usage; I am
trampled upon, I am torn and wounded with the most cutting strokes; I
am pillaged of the treasures hidden in my most secret chambers; notwithstanding
which I am always ready to return good for evil, and am
continually subservient to the pleasures or advantage of others; yet so
ungrateful is the world, that because I do not possess all the airiness and
activity of my sisters, I am stigmatized as dull and heavy. Every sordid,
miserly fellow is called by way of derision one of my children; and if a
person on entering a room does but turn his eyes upon me, he is thought
stupid and mean, and not fit for good company. I have the satisfaction,
however, of finding that people always incline towards me as they grow
older; and that those who seemed proudly to disdain any affinity with
me, are content to sink at last into my bosom. You will probably wish
to have some account of my person. I am not a regular beauty; some of
my features are rather harsh and prominent, when viewed separately;
but my countenance has so much variety of expression, and so many
different aspects of elegance, that those who study my face with attention
find out continually new charms; and it may be truly said of me, what
Titus says of his mistress, and for a much longer space:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Though I have been so long a mother, I have still a surprising air of
youth and freshness, which is assisted by all the advantages of well-chosen
ornament, for I dress well, and according to the season.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is what I have to say chiefly of myself and my sisters. To a
person of your sagacity it will be unnecessary for me to sign my name.
Indeed, one who becomes acquainted with any one of the family, cannot
be at a loss to discover the rest, notwithstanding the difference in our
features and characters.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>THE GAIN OF A LOSS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Philander possessed a considerable place about the court, which obliged
him to live in a style of show and expense. He kept high company, made
frequent entertainments, and brought up a family of several daughters in
all the luxurious elegance which his situation and prospects seemed to
justify. His wife had balls and routs at her own house, and frequented
all the places of fashionable amusement. After some years passed in this
manner, a sudden change of parties threw Philander out of his employment,
and at once ruined all his plans of future advancement. Though
his place had been lucrative, the expense it led him into more than compensated
the profits, so that, instead of saving anything, he had involved
himself considerably in debt. His creditors, on hearing of the change in
his affairs, became so importunate, that, in order to satisfy them, he was
compelled to sell a moderate paternal estate in a remote county, reserving
nothing out of it but one small farm. Philander had strength of mind
sufficient to enable him at once to decide on the best plan to be followed
in his present circumstances; instead, therefore, of wasting his time and
remaining property in fruitless attempts to interest his town friends in his
favour, he sold off his fine furniture, and without delay carried down his
whole family to the little spot he could still call his own, where he commenced
a life of industry and strict frugality in the capacity of a small
farmer. It was long before the female part of his household could accommodate
themselves to a mode of living so new to them, and so destitute
of all that they had been accustomed to regard as essential to their very
existence. At length, however, mutual affection and natural good sense,
and above all, necessity, brought them to acquiesce tolerably in their
situation, and to engage in earnest in its duties. Occasional regrets,
however, could not but remain; and the silent sigh would tell whither
their thoughts were fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Philander perceived it, but took care never to embitter their feelings by
harsh chidings or untimely admonitions. But on the anniversary of their
taking possession of the farmhouse, he assembled them under a spreading
tree that grew before their little garden, and while the summer’s sun gilded
all the objects around, he thus addressed them:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear partners in every fortune, if the revolution of a year has had
the effect on your mind that it has on mine, I may congratulate you on
your condition. I am now able with a firm tone to ask myself, what have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>I lost? and I feel so much more to be pleased with than to regret, that the
question gives me rather comfort than sorrow. Look at yon splendid
luminary, and tell me if its gradual appearance above the horizon on a fine
morning, shedding light and joy over the wide creation, be not a grander
as well as a more heart-cheering spectacle than that of the most magnificent
saloon, illuminated with dazzling lustres. Is not the spirit of the
wholesome breeze, fresh from the mountain, and perfumed with wild
flowers, infinitely more invigorating to the senses than the air of the
crowded drawing-room, loaded with scented powder and essences? Did
we relish so well the disguised dishes with which a French cook strove to
whet our sickly appetites, as we do our draught of new milk, our homemade
loaf, and the other articles of our simple fare? Was our sleep so
sweet after midnight suppers and the long vigils of cards, as it is now,
that early rising and the exercises of the day prepare us for closing our
eyes as soon as night has covered everything with her friendly veil?
Shall we complain that our clothes at present only answer the purpose of
keeping us warm, when we recollect all the care and pains it cost us to
keep pace with the fashion, and the mortification we underwent at being
outshone by our superiors in fortune? Did not the vexation of insolent
and unfaithful servants overbalance the trouble we now find in waiting on
ourselves? We may regret the loss of society; but, alas! what was the
society of a crowd of visiters who regarded us merely as the keepers of a
place of public resort, and whom we visited with similar sensations? If
we formerly could command leisure to cultivate our minds and acquire
polite accomplishments, did we, in reality, apply much leisure to these
purposes, and is not our time now filled more to our satisfaction by
employments of which we cannot doubt the usefulness? not to say that
the moral virtues we are now called upon to exercise afford the truest
cultivation to our minds. What, then, have we lost? In improved health,
the charms of a beautiful country, a decent supply of all real wants, and
the love and kind offices of each other, do not we still possess enough for
worldly happiness? We have lost, indeed, a certain rank and station in
life; but have we not acquired another as truly respectable? We are
debarred the prospects of future advancement; but if our present condition
is a good one, why need we lament that it is likely to be lasting? The
next anniversary will find us more in harmony with our situation than
even the present. Look forward, then, cheerily. The storm is past. We
have been shipwrecked, but we have only exchanged a cumbrous vessel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>for a light pinnace, and we are again on our course. Much of our cargo
has been thrown overboard, but no one loses what he does not miss.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus saying, Philander tenderly embraced his wife and daughters.
The tear stood in their eyes, but consolation beamed on their hearts.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>WISE MEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“You may remember, Arthur,” said Mr. C. to his son, “that, sometime
ago, I endeavoured to give you a notion what a <em>great man</em> was.
Suppose we now talk a little about <em>wise men</em>?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“With all my heart, sir,” replied Arthur.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> A wise man, then, is <em>he who pursues the best ends by the
properest means</em>. But as this definition may be rather too abstract to
give you a clear comprehension of the thing, I shall open it to you by
examples. What do you think is the best end a man can pursue in life?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> I suppose to make himself happy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> True. And as we are so constituted that we cannot be happy
ourselves without making others happy, the best end of living is to
produce as much general happiness as lies in our power.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> But that is <em>goodness</em>, is it not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> It is; and therefore wisdom includes goodness. The wise man
always<a id='p346'></a> intends what is good, and employs skill or judgment in attaining
it. If he were to pursue the best things weakly, he could not be wise;
any more than if he were to pursue bad or indifferent things judiciously.
One of the wisest men I know is our neighbour Mr. Freeland.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> What, the justice?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> Yes, few men have succeeded more perfectly in securing their
own happiness, and promoting that of those around them. Born to a
competent estate, he early settled upon it, and began to improve it. He
reduced all his expenses within his income, and indulged no tastes that
could lead him into excesses of any kind. At the same time he did not
refuse any proper and innocent pleasures that came in his way; and his
house has always been distinguished for decent cheerfulness and hospitality.
He applied himself with diligence to mending the morals and improving
the condition of his dependants. He studied attentively the laws of his
country, and qualified himself for administering justice with skill and
fidelity. No one discovers sooner where the right lies, or takes surer
means to enforce it. He is the person to whom the neighbours of all
degrees apply for counsel in their difficulties. His conduct is always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>consistent and uniform—never violent, never rash, never in extremes, but
always deliberating before he acts, and then acting with firmness and
vigour. The peace and good order of the whole neighbourhood materially
depend upon him; and upon every emergency his opinion is the first
thing inquired after. He enjoys the respect of the rich, the confidence of
the poor, and the good-will of both.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> But I have heard some people reckon old Harpy as wise a man as he.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> It is a great abuse of words to call Harpy a wise man. He is
of another species—<em>a cunning man</em>—who is to a wise man what an ape
is to a human creature—a bad and contemptible resemblance.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> He is very clever, though; is he not?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> Harpy has a good natural understanding, a clear head, and a
cool temper; but his only end in life has been to raise a fortune by base
and dishonest means. Being thoroughly acquainted with all the tricks
and artifices of the law, he employed his knowledge to take undue
advantages of all who intrusted him with the management of their affairs;
and under colour of assisting them, he contrived to get possession of all
their property. Thus he has become extremely rich, lives in a great
house with a number of servants, is even visited by persons of rank, yet is
universally detested and despised, and has not a friend in the world. He
is conscious of this, and is wretched. Suspicion and remorse continually
prey upon his mind. Of all whom he has cheated, he has deceived himself
the most; and has proved himself as much a fool in the end he has
pursued, as a knave in the means.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> Are not men of great learning and knowledge wise men?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> They are so, if that knowledge and learning are employed to
make them happier and more useful. But it too often happens that their
speculations are of a kind neither beneficial to themselves nor to others;
and they often neglect to regulate their tempers while they improve their
understandings. Some men of great learning have been the most arrogant
and quarrelsome of mortals, and as foolish and absurd in their conduct as
the most untaught of their species.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> But are not a philosopher and a wise man the same thing?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> A philosopher is properly a <em>lover of wisdom</em>; and if he searches
after it with a right disposition, he will probably find it oftener than other
men. But he must practise as well as know, in order to be truly wise.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> I have read of the seven wise men of Greece. What were they?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> They were men distinguished for their knowledge and talents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>and some of them for their virtue, too. But<a id='p348'></a> wiser than them all was
Socrates, whose chief praise it was that he turned philosophy from vain
and fruitless disputation to the regulation of life and manners, and that
he was himself a great example of the wisdom he taught.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> Have we had any person lately very remarkable for wisdom?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> In my opinion, few wiser men have ever existed than the late
Dr. Franklin, the American. From the low station of journeyman-printer
to the elevated one of ambassador plenipotentiary from his country to the
court of France, he always distinguished himself by sagacity in discovering,
and good sense in practising, what was most beneficial to himself and
others. He was a great natural philosopher, and made some very brilliant
discoveries; but it was ever his favourite purpose to turn everything to
use, and to extract some practical advantage from his speculations. He
thoroughly understood <em>common life</em>, and all that conduces to its comfort;
and he has left behind him treasures of domestic wisdom, superior, perhaps,
to any of the boasted maxims of antiquity. He never let slip any
opportunity of improving his knowledge, whether of great things or of
small; and was equally ready to converse with a day-labourer and a
prime-minister upon topics from which he might derive instruction. He
rose to wealth, but obtained it by honourable means. He prolonged his
life by temperance to a great age, and enjoyed it to the last. Few men
knew more than he, and none employed knowledge to better purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> A man, then, I suppose, cannot be wise without knowing a great deal?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> If he knows everything belonging to his station, it is wisdom
enough; and a peasant may be as truly wise in his place as a statesman
or a legislator. You remember that fable of Gay, in which a shepherd
gives lessons of wisdom to a philosopher.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ar.</em> O yes—it begins:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Remote from cities lived a swain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Mr. C.</em> True. He is represented as drawing all his maxims of conduct
from observation of brute animals. And they, indeed, have universally
that character of wisdom, of pursuing the ends best suited to them by the
properest means. But this is owing to the impulse of unerring instinct.
Man has reason for his guide, and his wisdom can only be the consequence
of the right use of his reason. This will lead him to virtue. Thus the
fable we have been mentioning rightly concludes with—</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>A FRIEND IN NEED.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>George Cornish, a native of London, was brought up to the sea.
After making several voyages to the East Indies in the capacity of mate,
he obtained the command of a ship in the country-trade there, and passed
many years of his life in sailing from one port to another of the
Company’s different settlements, and residing at intervals on shore with
the superintendence of their commercial concerns. Having by these
means raised a moderate fortune, and being now beyond the meridian of
life, he felt a strong desire of returning to his native country, and seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>his family and friends, concerning whom he had received no tidings for a
long time. He realized his property, settled his affairs, and taking his
passage for England, arrived in the Downs after an absence of sixteen
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>He immediately repaired to London, and went to the house of an only
brother whom he had left possessed of a genteel place in a public office.
He found that his brother was dead, and the family broken up; and he
was directed to the house of one of his nieces, who was married and
settled at a small distance from town. On making himself known, he
was received with great respect and affection by the married niece, and a
single sister who resided with her; to which good reception the idea of
his bringing back with him a large fortune did not a little contribute.
They pressed him in the most urgent manner to take up his abode there,
and omitted nothing that could testify their dutiful regard to so near a
relation. On his part, he was sincerely glad to see them, and presented
them with some valuable Indian commodities which he had brought with
him. They soon fell into conversation concerning the family events that
had taken place during his long absence. Mutual condolences passed on
the death of the father; the mother had been dead long before. The
captain, in the warmth of his heart, declared his intention of befriending
the survivors of the family, and his wishes of seeing the second sister as
comfortably settled in the world as the first seemed to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said he, “are you two the only ones left? What is become of
my little smiling playfellow Amelia? I remember her as if it were
yesterday, coming behind my chair, and giving me a sly pull, and then
running away that I might follow her for a kiss. I should be sorry if
anything had happened to her.”—“Alas! sir,” said the eldest niece,
“she has been the cause of an infinite deal of trouble to her friends! She
was always a giddy girl, and her misconduct has proved her ruin. It
would be happy if we could all forget her!”—“What, then,” said the
uncle, “has she dishonoured herself? Poor creature!”—“I cannot say,”
replied the niece, “that she has done so in the worst sense of the word;
but she has disgraced herself and her family by a hasty foolish match
with one beneath her, and it is ended, as might have been expected, in
poverty and wretchedness.”—“I am glad,” returned the captain, “that it
is no worse; for though I much disapprove of improper matches, yet
young girls may fall into still greater evils, and where there is no crime,
there can be no irreparable disgrace. But who was the man, and what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>did my brother say to it?”—“Why, sir, I cannot say but it was partly my
father’s own fault; for he took a sort of liking to the young man, who
was a drawing-master employed in the family, and would not forbid him
the house, after we had informed him of the danger of an attachment
between Amelia and him. So when it was too late, he fell into a violent
passion about it, which had no other effect than to drive the girl directly
into her lover’s arms. They married, and soon fell into difficulties. My
father of course would do nothing for them; and when he died, he not
only disinherited her, but made us promise no longer to look upon her as
a sister.”—“And you <em>did</em> make that promise?” said the captain, in a tone
of surprise and displeasure. “We could not disobey our parent,” replied
the other sister; “but we have several times sent her relief in her necessities,
though it was improper for us to see her.”—“And pray, what has
become of her at last—where is she now?”—“Really, she and her husband
have shifted their lodgings so often, that it is sometime since we heard
anything about them.”—“Sometime! how long?”—“Perhaps half a year
or more.”—“Poor outcast!” cried the captain, in a sort of muttered half-voice;
“<em>I</em> have made no promise, however, to renounce thee. Be pleased,
madam,” he continued, addressing himself gravely to the married niece,
“to favour me with the last direction you had to this unfortunate sister.”
She blushed and looked confused; and at length, after a good deal of
searching, presented it to her uncle. “But, my dear sir,” said she, “you
will not think of leaving us to-day? My servant shall make all the
inquiries you choose, and save you the trouble; and to-morrow you can
ride to town, and do as you think proper.”—“My good niece,” said the
captain, “I am but an indifferent sleeper, and I am afraid things would
run in my head and keep me awake. Besides, I am naturally impatient,
and love to do my business myself. You will excuse me.”—So saying,
he took up his hat, and without much ceremony, went out of the house,
and took the road to town on foot, leaving his two nieces somewhat
disconcerted.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he arrived, he went without delay to the place mentioned, which
was a by-street near Soho. The people who kept the lodgings informed
him, that the persons he inquired after had left them several months, and
they did not know what was become of them. This threw the captain
into great perplexity; but while he was considering what he should do
next, the woman of the house recollected that Mr. Bland (that was the
drawing-master’s name) had been employed at a certain school, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>information about him might possibly be obtained. Captain Cornish
hastened away to the place, and was informed by the master of the school
that such a man had, indeed, been engaged there, but had ceased to
attend for some time past. “He was a very well-behaved, industrious
young man,” added the master, “but in distressed circumstances, which
prevented him from making that genteel appearance which we expect in
all who attend our school; so I was obliged to dismiss him. It was a
great force upon my <em>feelings</em>, I assure you, sir, to do so; but you know
the thing could not be helped.” The captain eyed him with indignant
contempt, and said, “I suppose, then, sir, your <em>feelings</em> never suffered
you to inquire where this poor creature lodged, or what became of him
afterward?”—“As to that,” replied the master, “every man knows his
own business best, and my time is fully taken up with my own concerns;
but I believe I have a note of the lodgings he then occupied—here it is.”
The captain took it, and turning on his heel, withdrew in silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>He posted away to the place, but there, too, had the mortification of
learning that he was too late. The people, however, told him that they
believed he might find the family he was seeking in a neighbouring alley,
at a lodging up three pair of stairs. The captain’s heart sunk within him;
however, taking a boy as a guide, he proceeded immediately to the spot.
On going up the narrow creaking staircase, he met a man coming down
with a bed on his shoulders. At the top of the landing stood another with
a bundle of blankets and sheets. A woman with a child in her arms was
expostulating with him, and he heard her exclaim, “Cruel! not to leave
me <em>one</em> bed for myself and my poor children!”—“Stop,” said the captain
to the man, “set down those things.” The man hesitated. The captain
renewed his command in a peremptory tone, and then advanced towards
the woman. They looked earnestly at each other. Through her pale
and emaciated features he saw something of his little smiler; and at
length, in a faint voice, he addressed her, “Are you Amelia Cornish?”—“That
<em>was</em> my name,” she replied. “I am your uncle,” he cried, clasping
her in his arms, and sobbing as if his heart would break. “My uncle!”
said she, and fainted. He was just able to set her down on the only
remaining chair, and take her child from her. Two other young children
came running up, and began to scream with terror. Amelia recovered
herself. “Oh, sir, what a situation you see me in!”—“A situation,
indeed!” said he. “Poor forsaken creature! but you have <em>one</em> friend
left!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>He then asked what was become of her husband? She told him, that
having fatigued himself with walking every day to a great distance for a
little employment that scarcely afforded them bread, he had fallen ill, and
was now in an hospital, and that after having been obliged to sell most of
their little furniture and clothes for present subsistence, their landlord had
just seized their only remaining bed for some arrears of rent. The captain
immediately discharged the debt, and causing the bed to be brought up
again, dismissed the man. He then entered into a conversation with his
niece about the events that had befallen her. “Alas! sir,” said she, “I
am sensible I was greatly to blame in disobeying my father, and leaving
his roof as I did; but perhaps something might be alleged in my excuse—at
least, years of calamity and distress may be an expiation. As to my
husband, however, he has never given me the least cause of complaint—he
has ever been kind and good, and what we have suffered has been
through misfortune, and not fault. To be sure, when we married, we did
not know how a family was to be maintained. His was a poor employment,
and sickness and other accidents soon brought us to a state of
poverty, from which we could never retrieve ourselves. He, poor man!
was never idle when he could help it, and denied himself every indulgence
in order to provide for the wants of me and the children. I did my
part too as well as I was able. But my father’s unrelenting severity made
me quite heart-broken; and though my sisters two or three times gave us
a little relief in our pressing necessities—for nothing else could have made
me ask in the manner I did—yet they would never permit me to see them,
and for some time past have entirely abandoned us. I thought Heaven
had abandoned us too. The hour of extremest distress was come; but
you have been sent for our comfort.”—“And your comfort, please God!
I will be,” cried the captain with energy. “You are my own dear child,
and your little ones shall be mine too. Dry up your tears—better days I
hope, are approaching.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Evening was now coming on, and it was too late to think of changing
lodgings. The captain procured a neighbour to go out for some provisions
and other necessaries, and then took his leave, with a promise of being
with his niece early the next morning. Indeed, as he proposed going to
pay a visit to her husband, she was far from wishing to detain him longer.
He went directly thence to the hospital, and having got access to the
apothecary, begged to be informed of the real state of his patient, Bland.
The apothecary told him that he laboured under a slow fever, attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>with extreme dejection of spirits, but that there were no signs of urgent
danger. “If you will allow me to see him,” said the captain, “I believe
I shall be able to administer a cordial more effectual, perhaps, than all
your medicines.” He was shown up to the ward where the poor man
lay, and, seated by his bedside, “Mr. Bland,” said he, “I am a stranger
to you, but I come to bring you some news of your family.” The sick
man roused himself, as it were, from a stupor, and fixed his eyes in silence
on the captain. He proceeded—“Perhaps you may have heard of an
uncle that your wife had in the East Indies—he is come home, and—and—I
am he.” Upon this he eagerly stretched out his hand, and taking
that of Bland, which was thrust out of the bedclothes to meet it, gave it
a cordial shake. The sick man’s eyes glistened—he grasped the captain’s
hand with all his remaining strength, and drawing it to his mouth, kissed
it with fervour. All he could say was, “God bless you!—be kind to poor
Amelia!”—“I will—I will,” cried the captain, “I will be a father to you
all. Cheer up—keep up your spirits—all will be well.” He then, with
a kind look and another shake of the hand, wished him a good night, and
left the poor man lightened at once of half his disease.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain went home to the coffee-house where he lodged, got a light
supper, and went early to bed. After meditating sometime with heartfelt
satisfaction on the work of the day, he fell into a sweet sleep, which lasted
till daybreak. The next morning early he rose and sallied forth in search
of furnished lodgings. After some inquiry, he met with a commodious
set, in a pleasant airy situation, for which he agreed. He then drove to
Amelia, and found her and her children neat and clean, and as well dressed
as their poor wardrobe would admit. He embraced them with the utmost
affection, and rejoiced Amelia’s heart with a favourable account of her
husband. He then told them to prepare for a ride with him. The children
were overjoyed at the proposal, and they accompanied him down to the
coach in high spirits. Amelia scarcely knew what to think or expect.
They drove first to a warehouse for ready-made linen, where the captain
made Amelia furnish herself with a complete set of everything necessary
for present use for the children and herself, not forgetting some shirts for
her husband. Thence they went to a clothes shop, where the little boy
was supplied with a jacket and trowsers, a hat and great coat, and the girl
with another great coat and a bonnet—both were made as happy as happy
could be. They were next all furnished with new shoes. In short, they
had not proceeded far, before the mother and three children were all in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>complete new habiliments, decent but not fine; while the old ones were
all tied up in a great bundle, and destined for some family still poorer than
they had been.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain then drove to the lodgings he had taken, and which he had
directed to be put in thorough order. He led Amelia upstairs, who knew
not whither she was going. He brought her into a handsome parlour, and
seated her in a chair. “This, my dear,” said he, “is your house. I hope
you will let me now and then come and see you in it?” Amelia turned
pale and could not speak. At length, a flood of tears came to her relief, and
she suddenly threw herself at her uncle’s feet, and poured out thanks and
blessings in a broken voice. He raised her, and kindly kissing her and her
children, slipped a purse of gold into her hand, and hurried downstairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>He next went to the hospital, and found Mr. Bland sitting up in bed,
and taking some food with apparent pleasure. He sat down by him.
“God bless you! sir,” said Bland, “I see now it is all a reality, and not
a dream. Your figure has been haunting me all night, and I have scarcely
been able to satisfy myself whether I had really seen and spoke to you, or
whether it was a fit of delirium. Yet my spirits have been lightened, and
I have now been eating with a relish I have not experienced for many days
past. But may I ask how is my poor Amelia and my little ones?”—“They
are well and happy, my good friend;” said the captain, “and I
hope you will soon be so along with them.” The apothecary came up
and felt his patient’s pulse. “You are a lucky doctor, indeed, sir,” said
he to Captain Cornish, “you have cured the poor man of his fever. His
pulse is as calm as my own.” The captain consulted him about the safety
of removing him; and the apothecary thought that there would be no
hazard in doing it that very day. The captain waited the arrival of the
physician, who confirmed the same opinion. A sedan-chair was procured,
and full directions being obtained for the future treatment, with the physician’s
promise to look after him, the captain walked before the chair, to
the new lodgings. On the knock at the door, Amelia looked out of the
window, and seeing the chair, ran down, and met her uncle and husband
in the passage. The poor man, not knowing where he was, and gazing
wildly around him, was carried upstairs and placed upon a good bed, while
his wife and children assembled around it. A glass of wine brought by
the people of the house restored him to his recollection, when a most
tender scene ensued, which the uncle closed as soon as he could, for fear
of too much agitating the yet feeble organs of the sick man.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>By Amelia’s constant attention, assisted by proper help, Mr. Bland
shortly recovered; and the whole family lost their sickly, emaciated
appearance, and became healthy and happy. The kind uncle was never
long absent from them, and was always received with looks of pleasure
and gratitude that penetrated his very soul. He obtained for Mr. Bland
a good situation in the exercise of his profession, and took Amelia and
her children into his special care. As to his other nieces, though he did
not entirely break off his connexion with them, but, on the contrary,
showed them occasional marks of the kindness of a relation, yet he could
never look upon them with true cordiality. And as they had so well kept
their promise to their father of never treating Amelia as a sister, while in
her afflicted state, he took care not to tempt them to break it, now she was
in a favoured and prosperous condition.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>EARTH AND HER CHILDREN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>In a certain district of the globe things one year went so ill, that almost
the whole race of living beings, animals and vegetables, carried their
lamentations and complaints to their common mother <em>the Earth</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>First came <em>Man</em>. “O Earth,” said he, “how can you behold unmoved
the intolerable calamities of your favourite offspring! Heaven shuts up
all the sources of its benignity to us, and showers plagues and pestilence
on our heads—storms tear to pieces all the works of human labour—the
elements of fire and water seem let loose to devour us—and in the midst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>of all these evils some demon possesses us with a rage of worrying and
destroying one another; so that the whole species seems doomed to perish.
O, intercede in our behalf, or else receive us again into your maternal
womb, and hide us from the sight of these accumulated distresses!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The other animals then spoke by their deputies, the horse, the ox, and
the sheep. “O pity, mother Earth, those of your children that repose on
your breast, and derive their subsistence from your foodful bosom! We
are parched with drought, we are scorched by lightning, we are beaten by
pitiless tempests, salubrious vegetables refuse to nourish us, we languish
under disease, and the race of men treat us with unusual rigour. Never,
without speedy succour, can we survive to another year.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The vegetables next, those that form the verdant carpet of the earth,
that cover the waving fields of harvest, and that spread their lofty
branches in the air, sent forth their complaint:—“O, our general mother,
to whose breast we cleave, and whose vital juices we drain, have
compassion upon us! See, how we wither and droop under the baleful
gales that sweep over us—how we thirst in vain for the gentle dew of
Heaven—how immense tribes of noxious insects pierce and devour us—how
the famishing flocks and herds tear us up by the roots—and how
men, through mutual spite, lay waste and destroy us, while yet immature.
Already whole nations of us are desolated, and unless you save us,
another year will witness our total destruction.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My children,” said Earth, “I have now existed some thousand years;
and scarcely one of them has passed in which similar complaints have
not risen from one quarter or another. Nevertheless, everything has
remained in nearly the same state, and no species of created beings has
been finally lost. The injuries of one year are repaired by the gifts of
the succeeding one. The growing vegetables may be blasted, but the
seeds of others lie secure in my bosom, ready to receive the vital influence
of more favourable seasons. Animals may be thinned by want and
disease, but a remnant is always left, in whom survives the principle of
future increase. As to man, who suffers not only from natural causes,
but from the effects of his own follies and vices, his miseries rouse within
him the latent powers of remedy, and bring him to his reason again;
while experience continually goes along with him to improve his means
of happiness, if he will but listen to its dictates. Have patience, then, my
children! You were born to suffer, as well as to enjoy, and you must
submit to your lot. But console yourselves with the thought that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>have a kind Master above, who created you for benevolent purposes, and
will not withhold his protection when you stand most in need of it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>A SECRET CHARACTER UNVEILED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At a small house in a court in London, there resided for many years,
a person beyond the middle age of life, whose family consisted of one
male and one female servant, both of long standing. He was of grave
and somewhat pensive aspect. His dress was perfectly plain and never
varied. He wore his own gray hair, and his general appearance resembled
that of a Quaker, though without the peculiarities of that sect. He was
not known to his neighbours but by sight. They frequently observed
him go out and come in, almost always on foot, even in the worst
weather. He did not appear to keep any company, and his mode of life
seemed to be very uniform. He paid ready money to the few tradespeople
with whom he dealt, and never made any one call a second time for dues
and taxes. In some charitable collections that were set on foot in the
parish, he gave as much as was expected from him, and no more. He
returned the salutation of the hat to those who gave it him, but never
exceeded a word or two in conversation with his neighbours. His religion
and political sentiments were entirely unknown. The general notion
about him was, either that he was a reduced gentleman, obliged to live
privately, or one concerned in some private money transactions, and bent
upon hoarding a fortune. His name, from the parish-books, appeared to
be <em>Mortimer</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After he had thus lived a long time, a train of accidental circumstances
occurred within a short space, which fully displayed his character.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a blind alley at some little distance, there lived a poor widow who
had several children, the eldest a beautiful girl of eighteen. The woman
was very industrious, and supported her family by taking in work in
which her children assisted. It happened that some of them, and at
length herself, fell ill of a fever, which continued so long as to reduce
them to great distress. She was obliged to part with many things for a
present subsistence; and, on their recovery, a half-year’s rent being due
which she was unable to pay, the landlord threatened to seize the
remainder of her goods, and turn her and her children into the street.
He intimated, however, that it might be in the power of the eldest
daughter to settle accounts with him in a less difficult manner; but his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>hints were treated with virtuous disdain. The girl had a faithful lover,
a journeyman-carpenter, who, during the illness of the family, contributed
half his wages to their support, and now by promises endeavoured to
mollify the landlord, but in vain. He was coming disconsolately one
night after work to pay his usual visit to the distressed family, when he
observed Mr. Mortimer, whom he knew, having worked at his house,
stealing upstairs to the widow’s lodging. The suspicion natural to a
lover led him to follow. He saw him open the door, and he entered
unperceived after him. Mr. Mortimer walked into the room where were
all the poor family; the mother and eldest daughter weeping over the
rest. They showed much surprise at his approach, and still more, when,
going up to the widow, he put a purse of guineas into her hand, and
immediately turned about and went away. “What angel from heaven,”
cried the poor woman, “has brought me this? Run after him, daughter,
and thank him on your knees!” She ran, but he was got almost down
stairs. “I know him,” cried the journeyman-carpenter, making his
appearance, “’t is Mr. Mortimer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a chamber of a house in an obscure part of the town a gang of
clippers and coiners were detected by the officers of justice. A poor lame
fellow, who lived in the adjoining room, was brought along with the rest
for examination. “Well,” said one of the justices, “and who are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Please your worship, I am a poor man who have lost the use of my
limbs these seven years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how have you been supported all that time?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, sir, I might have starved long ago, as I have no settlement in
these parts, and the masters for whom I worked would do nothing for me,
but a very good gentleman has been so kind as to give me five shillings
a week for these six years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ay! you were lucky, indeed, to light upon such a kind gentleman.
Pray, what is his name?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know it, your worship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No!—that’s very strange, that you should not know the name of the
person who keeps you from starving. But where does he live?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, sir, I don’t know that neither. I know nothing at all of him
but the good he does me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, how came you at first to be acquainted with him?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I had just been turned out of the hospital incurable, and was thinking
that nothing remained for me but begging and starving in the streets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>when the gentleman came up to my poor lodging (God knows how he
found it) and gave me a guinea to buy some necessaries, and told me, if
I would do what little I could to maintain myself, he would take care
that I should not want. And ever since, either he or his man has brought
me a crown every week.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This story, my friend, will hardly pass. But tell me what trade you
worked at before you lost the use of your limbs?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Plating and gilding, your worship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“O! ho! Then you understand working in metals! You must be
kept till you give a more probable account of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor man in vain protested that every word he had said was true,
and offered to bring proof of his honesty and sobriety from his neighbours;
he was ordered to a place of confinement till further examination. The
constable was taking him thither, when by good fortune he chanced to
spy his benefactor crossing the street just before him. He called aloud,
and requested him to stop; and then in a piteous tone relating his story,
entreated him to go back with them to the justice, and bear witness in his
behalf. This could not be refused. They were admitted into a crowded
hall, when the constable told the cause of his return. All eyes were
turned upon the gentleman, who was desired to give his name. “It is
Mortimer,” said he. He then, in a few words, mentioned, that having
some years ago come to the knowledge of the poor man’s character and
distress, he had since taken care of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Tis enough, sir,” said a gentleman at the board; “I have the honour
of being a neighbour of yours, but I did not before know <em>what</em> a neighbour
I had.” Mr. Mortimer bowed and retired. The poor fellow was
discharged.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two maiden sisters, daughters of a very worthy tradesman, whom
misfortunes had reduced to poverty, and who died of a broken heart, were
for several years supported by an annuity of forty pounds each, which
came from an unknown quarter. The mode in which they received it
was, that twice a year, at night, a person knocked at the door of their
lodging, which was upon a second floor, and delivered into the hands of
one of them a parcel containing two twenty-pound bank-notes, with a
paper on which was written, “To be continued—no inquiry!” Though
this injunction prevented them from taking any steps to detect their
benefactor, yet many were the conjectures which, between themselves,
they made on this subject, but without attaining to the least probability.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>One night, about the time that the above-related events happened, the
person, who came as usual to deliver the notes, on hastily turning round
to retire, fell from the top of the stairs to the bottom. The lady shrieked
out, and running down, found the man lying senseless and bloody. Help
was procured, and he was taken up to their lodging. A surgeon was
immediately sent for, who, by bleeding and other means, restored him to
his senses. As soon as the man recovered his speech, he requested to be
taken to his master’s. “Who is your master?” cried the surgeon; “Mr.
Mortimer, of —— Court.”—“What!” exclaimed the elder of the ladies,
“Mr. Mortimer, my poor father’s greatest creditor—is it he to whom we
have been so long indebted for everything?” The man laid his finger on
his lips, and she was silent, but not a word had escaped the surgeon.
The servant was sent away in a coach, the surgeon accompanying him.
They arrived at Mr. Mortimer’s, where, after the confusion occasioned by
the accident had subsided, the surgeon found that the face of both master
and man were familiar to him. “I am sure I am not mistaken,” said he,
“you are the gentleman who so charitably took care of the poor fellow
that had such a bad broken leg in this neighbourhood, and paid me for my
attendance.” Mr. Mortimer assented. “Here is a double discovery,”
said the surgeon to himself; and on taking his leave, “Permit me to assure
you, sir,” he cried, “that I venerate you beyond any other human being!”—At
the corner of the court where Mr. Mortimer resided was a shoemaker’s
shop, kept by a man who had a wife and five children. He was one of
the most industrious creatures breathing, and with great exertions was
just able to maintain decently his family, of whom he was extremely fond.
A younger brother of his had come up out of the country, and obtained
a place in a public office, for which it was necessary to give security;
and he had prevailed upon his brother to enter into a joint bond with him
for two hundred pounds. The brother fell into vicious courses, and at
length absconded with all the money he was intrusted with. The shoemaker
was now called upon to pay the forfeiture of his bond, which, on
account of bad debts, and having been lately drained of all his ready
money to pay for leather, he was unable to do; and, in consequence, was
sent to jail. The distress this brought upon the family was aggravated
by the condition of his wife, who was near lying-in; and their mutual
affection was turned into a source of the bitterest grief. He had been
about six weeks in prison, without any prospect of release, all his friends
and relations having been in vain tried, when, one evening, the keeper who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>had treated him with much compassion, came up to his room with pleasure
in his countenance, and said, “You are free.” The poor man could
at first scarcely believe him, but finding him persist in the truth of it, he
almost fainted away through surprise and joy. When he was sufficiently
recovered to reflect on the matter, he was quite bewildered in conjecturing
how it had been brought about. He could only learn, that a discharge of
the debt bad been sent to the jail, and all the fees and expenses there paid
by a person whose name was unknown, but whose face they were well
acquainted with, as he had several times been on the same errand there
before. “O!” cried the shoemaker, “that I could but know my benefactor!”
He hastened home, where his unexpected appearance almost
overwhelmed his poor family. On talking over the business with his wife,
he learned that Mr. Mortimer’s servant had a few days before been at the
shop, and had been very particular in inquiring the cause and place of his
confinement. This occasioned a strong suspicion, for Mr. Mortimer’s
character now came to be talked of; and soon after it was changed into
certainty by a visit from the keeper of the prison, who acquainted the
shoemaker, that they had now discovered who his benefactor and that of
so many others was; one of their people having chanced to be at
the sessions-house when Mr. Mortimer appeared there in behalf of the
lame man taken up on suspicion, and having recognised him to be the
same person. The shoemaker was overjoyed at this intelligence, but
was still at a loss to know in what manner he ought to express his
gratitude. He was afraid of offending, by doing it in a public manner,
as it had evidently been Mr. Mortimer’s intention to remain concealed;
yet it was necessary that his heart should have some vent for its emotions.
He took his wife and children, and went to Mr. Mortimer’s house, desiring
to speak with him. Being admitted into the study, the poor man began
a speech which he had prepared; but instead of going on, he burst into a
fit of crying, fell on his knees, seizing one hand of his benefactor, while
his wife did the same on the other side, and kissing them with the utmost
fervency, both in a broken voice implored endless blessings on his head.
The children fell on their knees, too, and held up their little hands. Mr.
Mortimer was moved and remained awhile silent; at length, recollecting
himself, “Too much! too much!” he cried, “Go home, go home, my
good people! God bless you all!” and thus dismissed them.</p>

<p class='c000'>An old clergyman from the country came up to town on business about
this time, and paid a visit to an intimate friend of the same profession.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>After some mutual greetings and inquiries, “Ah! my good friend,” said
the country clergyman, “our parish has undergone a blessed alteration
since you knew it! The principal estate was sold some years ago to a
gentleman in London, who is one of those few that are never wearied in
well-doing. He built, in the first place, half a score neat cottages, where
all the industrious poor who are past labour are comfortably maintained at
his expense. He endowed a free school for all the children of the parish
without exception, where they are taught to read and write, and some of
the poorest are clothed. Every winter he orders the baker to deliver twice
a week a large loaf at the house of each cottager during the hard weather.
He has frequently remitted his rents to poor tenants in bad seasons; and,
in short, I should never have done were I to enumerate all his deeds of
charity. I myself have in various ways been much indebted to him, and
I am well informed that he contributes largely to the support of an aged
dissenting minister in the parish. But what is singular, he is very shy of
being seen, nor do we know anything of his rank and profession, or his
town residence; nay, I believe we should not have learned his name, had
not the purchase necessarily made it public. It is Mortimer.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why,” said his friend, “I have a parishioner of that name; and from
what I have lately heard of him, I suspect him to be the man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Could not I get a sight of him?” replied the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Probably you may,” said the other; and presently, seeing him cross
the court, he pointed him out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah! that is the blessed man!” exclaimed the old clergyman in a
rapture. And running out, he went up, grasped him eagerly by the hand,
and poured out the most affectionate wishes for his welfare.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Mortimer now stood <em>completely detected</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The world, however, was not satisfied with the general knowledge of
his goodness and benevolence. Curiosity was at work to discover his
connexions, habits, property, employment; in short, the whole personal
history of the man. One only friend, to whom he intrusted all the secrets
of his heart and life, thought fit, after he was removed from this mortal
state, to gratify the world in this particular.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Mortimer was a younger son of a respectable family in the country,
and came to London at an early age, to be educated for commercial life.
In this he succeeded so well, that after going through the different stages
of clerk, partner, and principal, he found himself possessed of a considerable
fortune. For sometime he made that use of his wealth which persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>who live within the bounds of what is called decency think permitted to
them. But the common pleasures of the world palled daily more and
more upon his taste. He found a void which could only be filled by
reading and contemplation. He grew fond of taking enlarged views of
mankind, their several conditions, characters, and destinations. He
compared the higher classes with the lower, the instructed with the
ignorant; above all, he examined <em>himself</em>, and inquired into the great
purpose for which he was brought into the world. In order to augment
his sphere of knowledge, he resolved to visit foreign countries; and having
no family encumbrances, he drew his affairs into a small compass,
relinquished business, and went abroad. During a course of some years,
he was a wanderer through most countries of Europe, travelling chiefly on
foot, avoiding common routes, and mingling with the mass of the people.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw, abroad as well as at home, a great deal of misery; he saw
wretchedness everywhere close in the train of splendour—indigence
by the side of prodigality—baseness under the foot of authority. He
lamented the evils of the world; but whatever might be their original
source, he saw that man had within himself the power of remedying
many of them. In exercising this power, all duty, all virtue seemed to
consist. “This, then,” said he, “must be the proper business of every
man in this life. It is then <em>mine</em>; and how shall I best perform it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Full of these meditations, he returned; and convinced that the great
inequality of rank and property is one principal cause (though a necessary
one) of the ills of life, he resolved, as much as it lay in his power, to
counteract it. “How few things,” thought he, “are necessary to my
external comfort! Wholesome food, warm clothing, clean lodging, a
little waiting upon, and a few books. This is all that even selfishness
asks of me. Whose, then, is the superfluity?”</p>

<p class='c000'>That he might at once get rid of the craving and burdensome demands
which <em>opinion</em> imposes, he took a house in a part of the town where his
name was unknown; and of all his former acquaintance, he only reserved
one or two congenial friends. He selected out of the number of his former
domestics one of each sex, steady and confidential, whose lives he made
as comfortable as his own. After all the expenses of his frugal, but not
scanty mode of living were discharged, there remained two thirds of his
income, which he never failed to bestow in secret charity. He chose that
his charities should be secret, not only as being utterly averse to all
ostentation, but also to avoid those importunities which might lead his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>bounty to unworthy objects. He would himself know the real circumstances
of every case; and it was the chief employment of his time, by
hunting into obscure corners, and searching out the private history of the
indigent classes of the community, to obtain exact information of the
existence of misery, and the proper modes of relieving it. He neglected
no kinds of distress, but it was his great delight to relieve virtuous poverty,
and alleviate those keen wounds of fortune which she inflicts on those
who have once participated in some share of her smiles. Hence the sums
which he bestowed were often so considerable as at once to retrieve the
affairs of the sufferer, nor did he think it right to withdraw his sustaining
hand as long as its support was needful.</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to his opinions on other subjects, his enlarged acquaintance
with men and books effectually preserved him from bigotry. He well
knew in what points mankind agreed, and in what they differed, and he
attached much superior importance to the former.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he lived—so he died! injuring none—benefiting many—bearing
with pious resignation the evils that fell to his own lot—continually
endeavouring to alleviate those of others—and hoping to behold a state in
which all evil shall be abolished.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A GLOBE-LECTURE.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div><em>Papa</em>—<em>Lucy</em>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'><em>Papa.</em> You may remember, Lucy, that I talked to you sometime ago
about the earth’s motion round the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lucy.</em> Yes, papa; and you said you would tell me another time something
about the other planets.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> I mean some day to take you to the lecture of an ingenious philosopher,
who has contrived a machine that will give you a better notion of
these things in an hour, than I could by mere talking in a week. But it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>is now my intention to make you better acquainted with this globe which
we inhabit, and which, indeed, is the most important to us. Cast your
eyes upon this little ball. You see it is a representation of the earth,
being covered with a painted map of the world. This map is crossed
with lines in various directions; but all you have to observe relative to
what I am going to talk about, is the great line across the middle called
the <em>equator</em> or <em>equinoctial line</em>, and the two points at top and bottom
called the <em>poles</em>, of which the uppermost is the northern, the lowermost
the southern.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I see them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Now, the sun, which illuminates all the parts of this globe by turns
as they roll round before it, shines directly upon the equator, but darts its
rays aslant toward the poles; and this is the cause of the great heat perceived
in the middle regions of the earth, and of its gradual diminution
as you proceed from them on either side toward the extremities. To use
a familiar illustration, it is like a piece of meat roasting before a fire, the
middle part of which is liable to be overdone, while the two ends are raw.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I can comprehend that.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> From this simple circumstance some of the greatest differences on
the surface of the earth, with respect to man, other animals, and vegetables,
proceed; for heat is the great principle of life and vegetation; and where
it most prevails, provided it be accompanied with due moisture, nature is
most replenished with all sorts of living and growing things. In general,
then, the countries lying on each side about the equator, and forming a
broad belt round the globe, called the <em>tropics</em>, or <em>torrid zone</em>, are rich and
exuberant in their products to a degree much superior to what we see in
our climates. Trees and other plants shoot to a vast size, and are clothed
in perpetual verdure, and loaded with flowers of the gayest colours and
sweetest fragrance, succeeded by fruits of high flavour or abundant nutriment.
The insect tribe is multiplied so as to fill all the air, and many of
them astonish by their size and extraordinary forms, and the splendour of
their hues. The ground is all alive with reptiles, some harmless, some
armed with deadly poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> O, but I should not like that at all!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> The birds, however, decked in the gayest plumage conceivable,
must give unmixed delight; and a tropical forest, filled with parrots,
macaws, and peacocks, and enlivened with the gambols of monkeys and
other nimble quadrupeds, must be a very amusing spectacle. The largest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>of quadrupeds, too, the elephant, the rhinoceros, and the hippopotamus,
are natives of these regions; and not only these sublime and harmless
animals, but the terrible lion, the cruel tiger, and all the most ravenous
beasts of prey, are here found in their greatest bulk and fierceness.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> That would be worse than the insects and reptiles.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> The sea likewise is filled with inhabitants of an immense variety
of size and figure; not only fishes, but tortoises, and all the shelly tribes.
The shores are spread with shells of a beauty unknown to our coasts; for
it would seem as if the influence of the solar heat penetrated into the
farthest recesses of nature.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> How I should like to ramble on the seaside there!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> But the elements, too, are there upon a grand and terrific scale.
The sky either blazes with intolerable beams, or pours down rain in irresistible
torrents. The winds swell to furious hurricanes, which often
desolate the whole face of nature in a day. Earthquakes rock the ground,
and sometimes open it in chasms which swallow up entire cities. Storms
raise the waves of the ocean into mountains, and drive them in a deluge
to the land.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Ah! that would spoil my shell-gathering. These countries may
be very fine, but I don’t like them.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well, then—we will turn from them to the <em>temperate</em> regions.
You will observe, on looking at the map, that these chiefly lie on the
northern side of the tropics; for on the southern side the space is almost
wholly occupied by sea. Though geographers have drawn a boundary
line between the torrid and temperate zones, yet nature has made none;
and for a considerable space on the borders, the diminution of heat is so
gradual as to produce little difference in the appearance of nature. But,
in general, the temperate <em>zones</em> or <em>belts</em> form the most desirable districts
on the face of the earth. Their products are extremely various, and
abound in beauty and utility. Corn, wine, and oil, are among their
vegetable stores: the horse, the ox, and the sheep, graze their verdant
pastures. Their seasons have the pleasing vicissitudes of summer and
winter, spring and autumn. Though in some parts they are subject to
excess of heat, and in others of cold, yet they deserve the general praise
of a mild temperature compared to the rest of the globe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> They are the countries for me, then.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> You <em>do</em> live in one of them, though our island is situated so far to
the north that it ranks rather among the cold countries than the warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>ones. However, we have the good fortune to be a long way removed from
those dreary and comfortless tracts of the globe which lie about the poles,
and are called the <em>frigid zones</em>. In these, the cheering influence of the
sun gradually becomes extinct, and perpetual frost and snow take possession
of the earth. Trees and plants diminish in number and size, till at
length no vegetables are found but some mosses and a few stunted herbs.
Land animals are reduced to three or four species—raindeer, white bears,
and arctic foxes. The sea, however, as far as it remains free from ice, is
all alive with aquatic birds, and with the finny tribe. Enormous whales
spout and gambol among the floating ice-islands, and herds of seals pursue
the shoals of smaller fish, and harbour in the caverns of the rocky coasts.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Then I suppose these creatures have not much to do with the
sun?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Nature has given them powers of enduring cold beyond those of
many other animals; and then the water is always warmer than the land
in cold climates; nay, at a certain depth, it is equally warm in all parts
of the globe.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Well, but as I cannot go to the bottom of the sea, I desire to have
nothing to do with these dismal countries. But do any men live there?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> It is one of the wonderful things belonging to man, that he is
capable of living in all parts of the globe where any other animals live.
And as nothing relative to this earth is so important to us as the condition
of human creatures in it, suppose we take a general survey of the different
races of men who inhabit all the tracts we have been speaking of?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Blacks, and whites, and all colours?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Surely. If a black dog is as much a dog as a white one, why
should not a black man be as much a man? I know nothing that colour
has to do with mind. Well, then—to go back to the equator. The middle
or tropical girdle of the earth, which by the ancients was concluded
to be uninhabitable from its extreme heat, has been found by modern discoveries
to be as well filled with men as it is with other living creatures.
And no wonder; for life is maintained here at less cost than elsewhere.
Clothes and fuel are scarcely at all necessary. A shed of bamboo covered
with palm-leaves serves for a house; and food is almost the spontaneous
produce of nature. The bread-fruit, the cocoa, the banana, and the
plantain, offer their stores freely to the gatherer; and if he takes the
additional pains to plant a few yams, or sow a little Indian corn, he is
furnished with never-failing plenty. Hence the inhabitants of many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>tropical countries live nearly in what is called a state of nature, without
care or labour, using the gifts of Providence like the animals around them.
The naked Indian, stretched at ease under the shade of a lofty tree, passes
his hours in indolent repose, unless roused to temporary exertion by the
passion of the chase, or the love of dancing and other social sports.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Well—that would be a charming life!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> So the poet Thomson seemed to think, when he burst into a
rapturous description of the beauties and pleasures afforded by these
favoured regions. Perhaps you can remember some of his lines?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I will try.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——“Thrown at gayer ease, on some fair brow</div>
      <div class='line'>Let me behold, by breezy murmurs cooled,</div>
      <div class='line'>Broad o’er my head the verdant cedar wave,</div>
      <div class='line'>And high palmettoes lift their grateful shade.</div>
      <div class='line'>O, stretched amid these orchards of the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Give me to drain the cocoa’s milky bowl,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from the palm to draw its freshening wine!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Delightful! Think, however, at what price they purchase this
indolent enjoyment of life. In the first place, all the work that is done
is thrown upon the women, who are always most tyrannized over, the
nearer a people approach to a state of nature.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> O, horrible! I am glad I do not live there.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Then the mind not having that spur to exertion which necessity
alone can give, moulders in inaction, and becomes incapable of those
advances in knowledge and vigour which raise and dignify the human
character.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> But that is the same with lazy people everywhere.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> True. The excessive heat, however, of these countries seems of
itself to relax the mind, and unfit it for its noblest exertions. And I
question if a single instance could be produced of an original inhabitant
of the tropics, who had attained to eminence in the higher walks of science.
It is their general character to be gay, volatile, and thoughtless, subject
to violent passions, but commonly mild and gentle, fond of society and
amusements, ingenious in little arts, but incapable of great or long-continued
efforts. They form a large portion of the human race, and
probably not the least happy. You see what vast tracts of land lie within
this division; most of Africa and South America, all the great islands of
Asia and two of its large peninsulas. Of these the Asiatic part is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>most populous and civilized; indeed, many of its nations are as far removed
from a state of nature as we are, and their constitutional indolence has
been completely overcome by necessity. The clothing of those who are
in a civilized state is mostly made of cotton, which is a natural product
of those climates. Their food is chiefly of the vegetable kind and besides
the articles already mentioned, consists much of rice.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Are the people all black?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yes; entirely or nearly so.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I suppose that is owing to the heat of the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Undoubtedly; for we find all the shades from jet black to tawny,
and at length white, as we proceed from the equator toward the poles.
The African negroes, however, from their curled woolly hair and their
flat features, have been supposed an originally distinct race of mankind.
The East Indian blacks, though under an equally hot climate, have long
flowing hair, and features not different from their fairer neighbours.
Almost all these nations are subject to despotic governments. In religion
they are mostly pagans, with a mixture of Mohammedans.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I think we have had enough about these people.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Well, then—look again on the globe to the northern side of the
tropics, and see what a tour we shall take among the inhabitants of the
north temperate zone. Here are all the most famous places on the earth;
rich, populous countries, renowned at different periods for arts and arms.
Here is the greatest part of Asia, a little of Africa, all Europe, and
North America.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I suppose, however, there must be great differences both in the
climate and the way of life, in so many countries?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Extremely great. The southern parts partake a good deal of the
character of the tropical regions. The heat is still excessive, and renders
exertion painful; whence the people have in general been reckoned soft,
effeminate, and voluptuous. Let us, however, look at them a little closer.
Here is the mighty empire of China, swarming with people to such a
degree, that, notwithstanding its size and fertility, the inhabitants are
obliged to exert the greatest industry to procure the necessaries of life.
Nearly in a line with it are the Mogul’s Empire, the kingdom of Persia,
and the Turkish dominions in Asia; all warm climates abounding in
products of use and beauty, and inhabited by numerous and civilized
people. Here stretches out the great peninsula of Arabia, for the most
part a dry and desert land, overspread with burning sands, only to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>crossed by the patient camel. Wild and ferocious tribes of men wander
over it, chiefly supported by their herds and flocks, and by the trade of
robbery, which they exercise on all travellers that fall in their way. A
tract somewhat similar, though in a colder climate, is the vast country of
Tartary, stretching like a belt from east to west across the middle of
Asia; over the immense plains and deserts of which, a number of independent
tribes continually roam, fixing their moveable habitations in one
part or another, according as they afford pasturage to their herds of cattle
and horses. These men have for many ages lived in the same simple
state, unacquainted as well with the arts as the vices of civilized nations.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Well. I think it must be a very pleasant life to ramble about from
place to place, and change one’s abode according to the season.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> The Tartars think so; for the worst wish they can find for man,
is that he may live in a house and work like a Russian. Now look at
Europe. See what a small figure it makes on the surface of the globe as
to size; and yet it has for many ages held the first place in knowledge,
activity, civilization, and all the qualities that elevate man among his
fellows. For this it is much indebted to that temperature of climate which
calls forth all the faculties of man in order to render life comfortable, yet
affords enough of the beauties of nature to warm the heart and exalt the
imagination. Men here earn their bread with the sweat of their brow.
Nature does not drop her fruits into their mouths, but offers them as the
price of labour. Human wants are many. Clothes, food, lodging, are all
objects of much care and contrivance, but the human powers fully exerted
are equal to the demand; and nowhere are enjoyments so various and
multiplied. What the land does not yield itself, its inhabitants by their
active industry procure from the remotest parts of the globe. When we
drink tea, we sweeten the infusion of a Chinese herb with the juice of a
West Indian cane; and your common dress is composed of materials
collected from the equator to the frigid zone. Europeans render all countries
and climates familiar to them; and everywhere they assume a superiority
over the less enlightened or less industrious natives.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> Then Europe for me, after all! But is not America as good?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> That part of North America which has been settled by Europeans,
is only another Europe in manners and civilization. But the original
inhabitants of that extensive country were bold and hardy barbarians, and
many of them continue so to this day. So much for the temperate zone,
which contains the prime of mankind. They differ extremely, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>in government, laws, customs, and religions. The Christian religion has
the credit of reckoning among its votaries all the civilized people of Europe
and America. The Mahometan possesses all the nearer parts of Asia,
and the north of Africa, but China, Japan, and most of the circumjacent
countries, profess different forms of paganism. The East, in general, is
enslaved to despotism; but the nobler West enjoys in most of its states
more or less of freedom.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the frigid zone, its few inhabitants can but just sustain a life little
better than that of the brutes. Their faculties are benumbed by the climate.
Their chief employment is the fishery or the chase, by which they
procure their food. The tending of herds of raindeer in some parts varies
their occupations and diet. They pass their long winters in holes dug
underground, where they doze out most of their time in stupid repose.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> I wonder any people should stay in such miserable places!</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Yet none of the inhabitants of the globe seem more attached to
their country and way of life. Nor do they, indeed, want powers to render
their situation tolerably comfortable. Their canoes, and fishing, and
hunting tackle, are made with great ingenuity; and their clothing is
admirably adapted to fence against the rigours of cold. They are not
without some amusements to cheer the gloom of their condition: but they
are abjectly superstitious, and given to fear and melancholy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Lu.</em> If I had my choice, I would rather go to a warmer than a colder
country.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pa.</em> Perhaps the warmer countries are pleasanter; but there are few
advantages which are not balanced by some inconveniences; and it is the
truest wisdom to be contented with our lot, and endeavour to make the
best of it. One great lesson, however, I wish you to derive from this
<em>globe-lecture</em>. You see that no part of the world is void of our human
brethren, who, amid all the diversities of character and condition, are
yet all <em>men</em>, filling the station in which their Creator has placed them.
We are too apt to look at the differences of mankind, and to undervalue
all those who do not agree with us in matters that we think of high
importance. But who are we—and what cause have we to think ourselves
right, and all others wrong? Can we imagine that hundreds of millions
of our species in other parts of the world are left destitute of what is
essential to their well-being, while a favoured few like ourselves are the
only ones who possess it? Having all a common nature, we must necessarily
agree in more things than we differ in. The road to virtue and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>happiness is alike open to all. The mode of pursuit is various: the end
is the same.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>ENVY AND EMULATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At one of the celebrated schools of painting in Italy, a young man
named Guidotto produced a piece so excellent, that it was the admiration
of the masters in the art, who all declared it to be their opinion that he
could not fail of rising to the summit of his profession, should he proceed
as he had begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>This performance was looked upon with very different eyes by two of
his fellow-scholars. Brunello, the elder of them, who had himself acquired
some reputation in his studies, was mortified in the highest degree at this
superiority of Guidotto; and regarding all the honour his rival had acquired
as so much taken from himself, he conceived the most rancorous dislike
of him, and longed for nothing so much as to see him lose the credit he
had gained. Afraid openly to decry the merit of a work which had obtained
the approbation of the best judges, he threw out secret insinuations that
Guidotto had been assisted in it by one or other of his masters; and he
affected to represent it as a sort of lucky hit, which the reputed author
would never equal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not so Lorenzo. Though a very young proficient in the art, he comprehended
in its full extent the excellence of Guidotto’s performance, and
became one of the sincerest of his admirers. Fired with the praises he
saw him receive on all sides, he ardently longed one day to deserve the
like. He placed him before his eyes as a fair model, which it was his
highest ambition to arrive at equalling—for, as to excelling him, he could
not as yet conceive the possibility of it. He never spoke of him but with
rapture, and could not bear to hear the detractions of Brunello.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Lorenzo did not content himself with words. He entered with his
whole soul into the career of improvement—was first and last of all the
scholars in the designing-room—and devoted to practice at home those
hours which the other youths passed in amusement. It was long before
he could please himself with any of the attempts, and he was continually
repeating over them, “Alas! how far distant is this from Guidotto’s!”
At length, however, he had the satisfaction of becoming sensible of
progress; and having received considerable applause on account of one
of his performances, he ventured to say to himself, “And why may not I
too become a Guidotto?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Meanwhile, Guidotto continued to bear away the palm from all
competitors. Brunello struggled awhile to contest with him, but at
length gave up the point, and consoled himself under his inferiority by
ill-natured sarcasm and petulant criticism. Lorenzo worked away in
silence, and it was long before his modesty would suffer him to place any
piece of his in view at the same time with one of Guidotto’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a certain day in the year in which it was customary for all
the scholars to exhibit their best performance in a public hall, where their
merit was solemnly judged by a number of select examiners, and a prize
of value was awarded to the most excellent. Guidotto had prepared for
this anniversary a piece which was to excel all he had before executed.
He had just finished it on the evening before the exhibition, and nothing
remained but to heighten the colouring by means of a transparent varnish.
The malignant Brunello contrived artfully to convey into the vial
containing this varnish some drops of a caustic preparation, the effect of
which would be entirely to destroy the beauty and splendour of the piece.
Guidotto laid it on by candlelight, and then with great satisfaction hung
up his picture in the public room against the morrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lorenzo, too, with beating heart, had prepared himself for the day.
With vast application he had finished a piece which he humbly hoped
might appear not greatly inferior to some of Guidotto’s earlier performances.</p>

<p class='c000'>The important day was now arrived. The company assembled, and
were introduced into the great room, where the light had just been fully
admitted by drawing up a curtain. All went up with raised expectations
to Guidotto’s picture, when, behold! instead of the brilliant beauty they
had conceived, there was nothing but a dead surface of confused and
blotched colours. “Surely,” they cried, “this cannot be Guidotto’s!”
The unfortunate youth himself came up, and in beholding the dismal
change of his favourite piece, burst out into an agony of grief, and
exclaimed that he was betrayed and undone. The vile Brunello in a
corner was enjoying his distress. But Lorenzo was little less affected
than Guidotto himself. “Trick! knavery!” he cried. “Indeed, gentlemen,
this is not Guidotto’s work: I saw it when only half finished, and it was
a most charming performance. Look at the outline, and judge what it
must have been before it was so basely injured.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The spectators were all struck with Lorenzo’s generous warmth, and
sympathized in the disgrace of Guidotto; but it was impossible to adjudge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>the prize to his picture, in the state in which they beheld it. They
examined all the others attentively, and that of Lorenzo, till then an
unknown artist to them, gained a great majority of suffrages. The prize
was therefore awarded to him; but Lorenzo, on receiving it, went up to
Guidotto, and presenting it to him, said, “Take what merit would
undoubtedly have acquired for you, had not the basest malice and envy
defrauded you of it. To me it is honour enough to be accounted your
second. If hereafter I may aspire to equal you, it shall be by means of
fair competition, not by the aid of treachery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lorenzo’s nobleness of conduct excited the warmest encomiums among
the judges, who at length determined, that for this time there should be
two equal prizes distributed; for that if Guidotto had deserved the prize
of painting, Lorenzo was entitled to that of virtue.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>PROVIDENCE; OR, THE SHIPWRECK.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was a dreadful storm. The wind blowing full on the seashore,
rolled tremendous waves on the beach, while the half-sunk rocks at the
entrance of the bay were enveloped in a mist of white foam. A ship
appeared in the offing, driving impetuously under her bare poles to land;
now tilting aloft on the surging waves, now plunging into the intervening
hollows. Presently, she rushed among the rocks, and there struck, the
billows beating over her deck, and climbing up her shattered rigging.
“Mercy! mercy!” exclaimed an ancient solitary, as he viewed from the
cliff the dismal scene. It was in vain. The ship fell on her side and was
seen no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon, however, a small, dark object appeared coming from the rocks
toward the shore; at first, dimly descried through the foam, then quite
plain as it rode on the summit of a wave, then for a time totally lost. It
approached, and showed itself to be a boat with men in it rowing for their
lives. The solitary hastened down to the beach, and in all the agonizing
vicissitudes of hope and fear watched its advance. At length, after the
most imminent hazards, the boat was thrown violently on the shore, and
the dripping, half-dead mariners crawled out on dry land.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heaven be praised!” cried the solitary, “what a providential escape!”
And he led the poor men to his cell, where, kindling a good fire, and
bringing out his little store of provisions, he restored them to health and
spirits. “And are you six men the only ones saved?”—“That we are,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>answered one of them. “Threescore and fifteen men, women, and
children, were in the ship when she struck. You may think what a
clamour and confusion there were: women clinging to their husbands’
necks, and children hanging about their clothes, all shrieking, crying, and
praying! There was no time to be lost. We got out the small-boat in
a twinkling—jumped in, without staying for our captain, who was fool
enough to be minding the passengers—cut the rope, and pushed away just
time enough to be clear of the ship as she went down; and here we are,
all alive and merry!” An oath concluded his speech. The solitary was
shocked, and could not help secretly wishing that it had pleased Providence
to have saved some of the innocent passengers, rather than these reprobates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sailors having got what they could, departed, scarcely thanking
their benefactor, and marched up the country. Night came on. They
descried a light at some distance, and made up to it. It proceeded from
the window of a good-looking house, surrounded with a farmyard and
garden. They knocked at the door, and in a supplicating tone made
known their distress, and begged relief. They were admitted, and treated
with compassion and hospitality. In the house were the mistress, her
children, and women-servants, an old man and a boy: the master was
abroad. The sailors, sitting round the kitchen fire, whispered to each
other that here was an opportunity of making a booty that would amply
compensate for the loss of clothes and wages. They settled their plan;
and on the old man’s coming with logs to the fire, one of them broke his
scull with the poker, and laid him dead. Another took up a knife which
had been brought with the loaf and cheese, and running after the boy,
who was making his escape out of the house, stabbed him to the heart.
The rest locked the doors, and after tying all the women and children,
began to ransack the house. One of the children continuing to make
loud exclamations, a fellow went and strangled it. They had nearly
finished packing up such of the most valuable things as they could carry
off, when the master of the house came home. He was a smuggler
as well as a farmer, and had just returned from an expedition, leaving his
companions with their goods at a neighbouring public-house. Surprised
at finding the doors locked, and seeing lights moving about in the chambers,
he suspected something amiss; and upon listening, he heard strange
voices, and saw some of the sailors through the windows. He hastened
back to his companions, and brought them with him just as the robbers
opened the door, and were coming out with their pillage, having first set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>fire to the house, in order to conceal what they had done. The smuggler
and his friends let fly their blunderbusses in the midst of them, and then
rushing forward, seized the survivors, and secured them. Perceiving
flames in the house, they ran and extinguished them. The villains were
next day led to prison amid the curses of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The good solitary, on hearing of the event, at first exclaimed, “What a
wonderful interference of Providence, to punish guilt, and protect
innocence!” Pausing awhile, he added, “Yet had Providence thought
fit to have drowned these sailors in their passage from the ship, where
they left so many better people to perish, the lives of three innocent persons
would have been saved, and these wretches would have died without
such accumulated guilt and ignominy. On the other hand, had the
master of the house been at home, instead of following a lawless and
desperate trade, he would perhaps have perished with all his family, and
the villains have escaped with their booty. What am I to think of all
this?” Thus pensive and perplexed he laid him down to rest, and after
some time spent in gloomy reflections, fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his dream he fancied himself seated on the top of a high mountain,
where he was accosted by a venerable figure in a long white garment,
who asked him the cause of the melancholy expressed on his countenance.
“It is,” said he, “because I am unable to reconcile the decrees of Providence
with my ideas of wisdom and justice.”—“That,” replied the
stranger, “is probably because thy notions of Providence are narrow and
erroneous. Thou seekest it in <em>particular events</em>, and dost not raise thy
survey to the <em>great whole</em>. Every occurrence in the universe is <em>providential</em>,
because it is the consequence of those laws which divine wisdom
has established as most productive of the general good. But to select
individual facts as more directed by the hand of Providence than others,
because we think we see a particular good purpose answered by them, is
an infallible inlet to error and superstition. Follow me to the edge of
the cliff.” He seemed to follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now look down,” said the stranger, “and tell me what thou seest.”
“I see,” replied the solitary, “a hawk darting amid a flock of small birds,
one of which he has caught, while the others escape.”—“And canst thou
think,” rejoined the stranger, “that the single bird made a prey of by the
hawk lies under any particular doom of Providence, or that those who fly
away are more the objects of divine favour than it? Hawks by nature
were made to feed upon living prey, and were endowed with strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>and swiftness to enable them to overtake and master it. Thus life is
sacrificed to the support of life. But to this destruction limits are set.
The small birds are much more numerous and prolific than the birds of
prey; and though they cannot resist his force, they have dexterity and
nimbleness of flight sufficient in general to elude his pursuit. It is in this
<em>balance</em> that the wisdom of Providence is seen; and what can be a greater
proof of it, than that both species, the destroyer and his prey, have
subsisted together from their first creation? Now, look again, and tell
me what thou seest.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I see,” said the solitary, “a thick black cloud gathering in the sky.
I hear the thunder rolling from side to side of the vault of heaven. I
behold the red lightning darting from the bosom of darkness. Now it has
fallen on a stately tree and shattered it to pieces, striking to the ground
an ox sheltered at its foot. Now it falls again in the midst of a flock of
timorous sheep, and several of them are left on the plain;—and see! the
shepherd himself lies extended by their side. Now it strikes a lofty spire,
and at the same time sets in a blaze an humble cottage beneath. It is an
awful and terrible sight!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is so,” returned the stranger, “but what dost thou conclude from
it? Dost thou not know, that from the genial heat which gives life to
plants and animals, and ripens the fruits of the earth, proceeds this
electrical fire, which ascending to the clouds, and charging them beyond
what they are able to contain, is launched again in burning bolts to the
earth? Must it leave its direct course to strike the tree rather than the
dome of worship, or to spend its fury on the herd rather than the herdsman!
Millions and millions of living creatures have owed their birth to this
active element; and shall we think it strange if a few meet their deaths
from it? Thus the mountain torrent that rushes down to fertilize the
plain, in its course may sweep away the works of human industry, and
man himself with them; but could its benefits be purchased at another
price?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All this,” said the solitary, “I tolerably comprehend; but may I
presume to ask whence have proceeded the <em>moral evils</em> of the painful
scenes of yesterday? What good end is answered by making man the
scourge of man, and preserving the guilty at the cost of the innocent?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That, too,” replied the venerable stranger, “is a consequence of the
same wise laws of Providence. If it was right to make man a creature of
habit, and render those things easy to him with which he is most familiar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>the sailor, of course, must be better able to shift for himself in a shipwreck
than the passenger; while that self-love, which is essential to the
preservation of life must, in general, cause him to consult his own safety
before that of others. The same force of habit in a way of life full of
peril and hardship, must conduce to form a rough, bold, and unfeeling
character. This, under the direction of principle, will make a brave man;
without it, a robber and a murderer. In the latter case, human laws step
in to remove the evil which they have not been able to prevent. Wickedness
meets with the fate which sooner or later always awaits it; and
innocence, though it occasionally suffers, is proved in the end to be the
surest path to happiness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” resumed the solitary, “can it be said that the lot of innocence
is <em>always</em> preferable to that of guilt in this world?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If it cannot,” replied the other, “thinkest thou that the Almighty is
unable to make retribution in a future world? Dismiss, then, from thy
mind the care of <em>single events</em>, secure that the <em>great whole</em> is ordered for
the best. Expect not a particular interposition of Heaven, because such
an interposition would seem to thee seasonable. Thou, perhaps, wouldest
stop the vast machine of the universe to save a fly from being crushed
under its wheels. But innumerable flies and men are crushed every day,
yet the grand motion goes on, and will go on, to fulfil the benevolent
intentions of its Author.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He ceased, and sleep on a sudden left the eyelids of the solitary. He
looked abroad from his cell, and beheld all nature smiling around him.
The rising sun shone in a clear sky. Birds were sporting in the air, and
fish glancing on the surface of the waters. Fleets were pursuing their
steady course, gently wafted by the pleasant breeze. Light fleecy clouds
were sailing over the blue expanse of heaven. His soul sympathized with
the scene, and peace and joy filled his bosom.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
